**PINTEREST TAG: Can I fire my own Pinterest events?**

Yes, you can fire your own Pinterest tags events effortless.

*URL includes (supports delay)
*URL equals (supports delay)
*Click on HTML link (pro)
*Click on CSS Selector (pro)

*Page scroll (pro)

**PINTEREST TAG: I use WooCommerce or EDD, do I need to add the Pinterest events myself?**

No, absolutely not!
The plugin will fire all the Pinterest e-commerce events automatically.

**Will your plugin increase the loading time of my site?**

The plugin itself is really fast. However, you have to remember that the pixel has to communicate with Facebook, Google, or Pinterest to send all the data, and this will add a little load on your site.

Will this impact on your visitors? No, because all the requests are asynchronous, meaning that the browser will continue to load and your users will not see any delay whatsoever.

**Are there any known incompatibilities with other themes or plugins?**

There are a few you should consider:

*Any plugin or solution that implements the same pixel or tag. Having the same tracking pixel added twice can cause problems.

*We had a problem with Mamaya, a retargeting service.

*It won’t work with LeadPages or any similar system because those pages are generated outside WordPress.

*Some clients reported problems with Thrive landing pages. This happens because Thrive removes other plugins JS files. 

There's a strange solution: it appears that if you have the Yoast plugin installed the problem will go away.

*Upsell plugins can cause problems with purchase tracking. If they add an intermediary page after the transaction, we have [a filter their developer can use to call our default Purchase event](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/the_mister/zeaXya)
