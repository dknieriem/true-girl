Include Google Remarketing Ad Codes on a per page or post basis. There is also a spot for a default code.

== Description ==

Allows you to specify a default Google Display Network Remarketing tracking code to your entire site. You can then override that code on a per post/page/custom_post_type basis. 

Basic structure taken from the Adwords-Remarketing plugin, but added much needed default behavior and settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. Setting Page.
2. New meta box that shows on the add/edit forms
3. View source of the embed

== Installation ==

1. Add plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navigate to 'Settings' -> 'Google Remarketing' to specify a default tracking code and which post types you want to be able to override.
1. When you are adding or editing pages you will now have a new meta box to enter a custom pixel for that page.

== Changelog ==

* Settings link on plugin page
