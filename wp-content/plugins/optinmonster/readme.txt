= Best WordPress Popup Plugin =
By now you know that online visitors have a pattern: find, read, leave.

And, you know that 70% of those visitors will never return. That's why you're here, right?

You want the best WordPress popup plugin to help you get some (okay, a lot) of your site visitors to stay on your site a little longer, buy something, or at least sign up for your email list so you can market to them later.

That's what OptinMonster was made to do. And, we do it really well. The OptinMonster WordPress popup plugin helps you grow your email list and get more subscribers with popups and other types of high converting optin forms.

> <strong>OptinMonster App</strong><br>

= Powerful Exit Intent&reg; Technology =

OptinMonster is a pioneer of <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/" rel="friend" title="Exit-Intent Technology">exit intent popup technology</a>.

Exit Intent&reg; helps you track your user's mouse behavior and prompts them with a targeted popup message at the precise moment they are about to leave.

Our WordPress exit popups allow you to re-engage the visitor and encourage them to subscribe to your email list or complete their purchase. Exit intent is proven to increase conversions.

We used it on our site, <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/" rel="friend" title="WPBeginner - Beginners Guide to WordPress">WPBeginner</a>, and increased conversions by over 600%.

But the success doesn't stop there. Check out what one of our customers, and a respected industry leader, was able to do:

OptinMonster's <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/page-level-targeting/" rel="friend" title="Page Level Targeting">page level targeting module</a> allows you to display unique offers and campaigns based on visitor's location and interaction on your website.

This means you can segment your email list and group subscribers based on their interest and interaction with your website, leading to higher open rates, higher click-through rates, increased sales, greater revenue, greater customer retention, and lower unsubscribe rates.

Well, we changed all that and now _it just works_ as part of the best WordPress popup plugin on the market.

OptinMonster's easy <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/easy-ab-split-testing/" rel="friend" title="A/B split testing">A/B split testing</a> tool helps you eliminate the guess work and make data-driven decisions on what works best for your popups and other optin forms.
