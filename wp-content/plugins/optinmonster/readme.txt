Let's take a look at how the OptinMonster WordPress popup plugin can help you grow your email list and achieve your business goals.

= Drag-and-Drop Builder + Optin Forms Templates =

= Easy Integration with All Email Marketing Services =

OptinMonster started with the goal to make the most beginner-friendly WordPress popup plugin to grow your email list and increase sales. That's why it just works out of the box with all popular email marketing service providers including but not limited to:

Mailchimp, AWeber, Drip, ConvertKit, Infusionsoft, GetResponse, Constant Contact, CampaignMonitor, Hubspot, Marketo, ActiveCampaign, Pardot, TotalSend, Emma, iContact, MailerLite, Customer.io, MailPoet, and FeedBlitz.

You can also use custom HTML forms as well as use shortcodes to add other form plugins like WPForms, Formidable Forms, and more.

= Powerful Exit Intent® Technology =

OptinMonster is a pioneer of [exit intent popup technology](https://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/ "Exit-Intent Technology" ).

Exit Intent® helps you track your user's mouse behavior and prompts them with a targeted popup message at the precise moment they are about to leave.

Our WordPress exit popups allow you to re-engage the visitor and encourage them to subscribe to your email list or complete their purchase. Exit intent is proven to increase conversions.

We used it on our site, [WPBeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com/ "WPBeginner - Beginners Guide to WordPress" ), and increased conversions by over 600%.

But the success doesn't stop there. Check out what one of our customers, and a respected industry leader, was able to do:

> In only 7 months, **we added more than 95,000 names to our email list** using OptinMonster's Exit Intent™ technology. We strongly recommend it!

> Michael Stelzner - Founder of Social Media Examiner

= Advanced Page Level Targeting and Behavior Personalization =

Our WordPress popup plugin integrates with our powerful targeting and segmentation engine so you can show your perfect popup offer to the right people at the exact right time and maximize your website conversions.

OptinMonster's [page level targeting module](https://optinmonster.com/features/page-level-targeting/ "Page Level Targeting" ) lets you show unique offers and campaigns based on visitor's location and interaction on your website.

This means you can segment your email list and group subscribers based on their interest and interaction with your website, leading to higher open rates, higher click-through rates, increased sales, greater revenue, greater customer retention, and lower unsubscribe rates.

Check out the impact this had for one of our users:

> OptinMonster played a critical role in increasing my email optin conversion rate by 469%. In real numbers, **that is the difference between $7,765 and $47,748 per month** in revenue.

> Matthew Woodward - Professional Blogger and SEO Expert

= Easy to Use A/B Split Testing =

A/B testing is one of the most desired features, but normally it's extremely hard for beginners to get it going.

Well, we changed all that and now _it just works_ as part of the best WordPress popup plugin on the market.

OptinMonster's easy [A/B split testing](https://optinmonster.com/features/easy-ab-split-testing/ "A/B split testing" ) tool helps you eliminate the guess work and make data-driven decisions on what works best for your popups and other optin forms.

You can try different content, headlines, layouts, styles, and optin triggers to see what converts best.
