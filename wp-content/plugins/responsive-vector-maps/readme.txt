Create responsive linkable maps, many customizations possible, toggle elements on the page or display content over the maps, all settings in one page.

== Description ==

Create responsive linkable vector maps in one click, many customizations possible, toggle elements on the page or display content over the maps. All settings in one page !

Vector maps never loose quality when reducing or increasing their sizes. Using RVM you will not need to create static images for area map tags.

You can use maps in sidebars or just in post/page content using shortcodes.


= Features = 

* Default maps available for free : Italy and whole World ( with clickable countries ).
* Responsive: Maps will adapt their width to any device
* High quality image
* Cross-browser compatibility
* More then 200  downloadable maps available on [responsivemapsplugin.com](//www.responsivemapsplugin.com/redirect-to-custom-maps-from-wp-plugin-page/) 
* Chance to install dynamic maps with all kind of svg ( not only geographical maps ! )
* Mouseover tooltip effect
* Linkable Subdivisions: Customize background colours, links and html popup ( tooltip )
* Subdivisions' actions : show/hide elements on the page and display label content when clicking on subdivisions
* Linkable Markers: Add your linkable markers on most of the maps using latitude and longitude. Chance to have html popup, dimension ( marker radius ) and min/max radius dimension scale
* Pinpoints: Use your favourite images as icons for markers' pinpoints  
* Customizable look and feel ( even transparent background )
* Preview functionality: WYSAWYG while creating/editing your map
* Shortcodes: Use generated shortcodes in your posts, pages or sidebars
* Widget: Maps can be used in widget area too 
* Zoom capabilities
* Export and Import features: backup and restore markers and subdivision settings in just one click



== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file from this page 
2. Login to your WordPress dashboard 
3. Go to Plugins > Add New, under Install Plugins title click on Upload and use the browse button to search the .zip file you have downloaded at point 1
4. Once activated you have a RVM tab on the left hand side
5. Start creating your favourite maps

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize map and canvas colours ? =

Yes, these are possible layout customizations:
 
1. Canvas colour
2. Map colour
3. Map border colour
4. Add zoom-in/zoom-out buttons
5. Map width ( can use em, %, px etc.. )
6. Region background colour, links and html labels
7. Markers background colour, border colour, links, dimension, html popup message and min/max radius dimension scale
8. Get rid of map padding

= Can I customize map region links ? =

Yes, it's possible to customize links for each region/area displayed in the map. When creating a new map or editing an existing one, you will have chance to
assign url to each area/region of the map. Default areas/regions have just a tooltip mouseover effect displaying area/region name.
Actually is possible to add a custom html tooltip in a secure way.
It's even possible show/hide elements on the page or show content over your maps.

= Which WP version is the plugin compatible with ? =

The plugin will work at its best from WP ver 3.6 onwards.

= I created a new map, but I would like to give specific width just for a specific post, is it possible ? =

Yes, you can create a new map which will adapt to your box container automatically and will be responsive, but you can even use 
an additional **width** parameter to the shortcode within a specific post. Your map will have specific width just for that post.


== Screenshots ==

1. RVM once installed into Wordpress
2. Start creating your map clicking on **Add New Map**
3. Regions/Countries section
4. Markers section
5. The result... finally! We see a widget sidebar and a content map ( Notice we used two different shortcode/ID for Italy map )

== Arbitrary section ==

ATTENTION: bare in mind that using same identical shortcode ( same post ID ) in more then one position on the same page will result into a layout issue:
in other words if you create a new map you should not use it in more then one position ( post/sidebar ) per page. 
That's because the javascript managing map creation fires same ID selector.

Create instead a new one and use it for your purposes.
