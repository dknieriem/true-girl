Originally, Secret Keeper was a book for teen girls about how to keep the deepest secrets of your beauty for just one man. It was very successful and we chose to use that name to approach teens in an age appropriate way about issues of modesty and purity. It is certainly not our intent to encourage girls to be secretive. You'll see our events and resources are a way to get moms and girls talking, talking, talking about everything!

Our popular books and events help moms cultivate God-crazy daughters who embrace inner beauty and biblical truths. Secret Keeper Girl live events bring mothers and daughters are filled with fun activities, dance parties, fashion shows and more - while saving time and space for important conversations that bring them closer to each other and Christ!

<div id="aboutIntro">

The Secret Keeper Girl Truth or Bare Fashion Tests were developed as a fun way for a girl and her mom to think about what she's wearing and monitor outfits for modesty. Often, cut-and-dry rules such as, <strong>"Your skirt should be two inches below the knee"</strong> and  <strong>"Your shorts need to come to the tips of your fingers"</strong>  are not always effective simply because each girl's body is unique! These tests have different results for every body type, age, and mind. We hope the suggested Truth or Bare guidelines help a girl think for herself as she comes to recognize the types of clothing that are modest - specific to her own body and fashion sense!

<h2>Test #1: Spring Valley</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> "Is my shirt too tight?"

<strong>Action:</strong> Take the tips of your fingers and press into your shirt, right where your ribs come together in the "valley" in the middle of your chest. When you take your fingers away, does your shirt immediately spring back like a small Smurf trampoline? If so, your shirt is too tight!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Try a different bra, since sometimes that can make a difference. But if it's still too tight get rid of that shirt. Buy your shirts based on fit, not size, because sizes can differ from brand to brand.</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Am I showing too much belly?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Stand up straight and raise both arms high in the air, like you are pointing up to Heaven. Is this exposing any belly? If so, your mom has permission to poke it!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Visit the men’s or boy’s department and buy a simple ribbed tank top (they often come in packages of three) to wear under your funky short T’s and crop tops or with your trendy low-riding jeans. Layering is an easy way to solve the belly problem!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Can you see my underpants”

<strong>Action:</strong> Bend over and touch your knees. Have your mom or a girl friend look at your bottom. Can she see the outline of your underpants? Can she see what color they are? How about your actual underwear because your pants are so low that you’re risking pulling a “plumber” exposure?

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> If your pants are so tight that you can see the outline of your panties, try buying pants one size larger! Wear flesh-tone panties with white or very light pants.</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #4: Mirror Image</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “How short is too short?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Get in front of a full-length mirror. If you are wearing shorts, sit down criss-cross applesauce. If you’re in a skirt, sit in a chair with your legs crossed, applesauce. If you’re in a skirt, sit in a chair with your legs crossed, ladylike. Now, what do you see in the mirror? If you see undies, or lots of thigh, your shorts or skirt is too short!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Buy longer shorts and skirts! We know that due to today’s fashions, these can sometimes be hard to find. Fix the length problem by adding a pair of funky, bright-colored tights under your shorts and too-short skirts!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Are my pants too low?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Sit cross-legged on the floor and bend over as if you are about to devour a great magazine. Now reach behind you and feel what might be the featured view if your pants are too low. (Or get your mom or a girlfriend to take a look!)

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> This is usually an easy fix with the Secret Weapon: a men’s tank or T-shirt, but be willing to consider that some low riders are just too low. Find a pair that won’t cause viewers to blush!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is it cold in here?”

<strong>Action:</strong> When we get cold or nervous we tend to “get nippy”… if you catch my drift. When this happens, it is visible to others if our bras are not thick enough. There is no real test for this one (at least not one that I would want to take!)

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> When you are wearing thinner shirts, wear a thicker bra. When you are wearing a sweater or thicker shirt, go for the thin and cute bra if you want!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #7: Stand in the Gap</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is my button-down shirt too tight?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Button down your shirt and stand sideways looking in the mirror. If any of the spaces between the buttons is gaping open, even just a little, you’re in danger of exposing way too much, and in danger of losing a button!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Try buying a size or two larger (if that number on the tag bothers you, just cut out the tag when you get home!) Or, try wearing a shirt under your button down and leave it unbuttoned for a layered look. Modesty is not just about how much of your beautiful epidermis is showing, but how much of your shape is showing!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is my shirt too low?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Take your hand and put your thumb in that little shelf under your neck (I have no idea what it is called, Collarbone maybe? Just feel around, you’ll find it.) Is there any skin showing below your hand? If so, you seriously need to rethink this shirt.

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Our Secret Weapon (the T-Shirt or tank) works for low shirts as well as short shirts!

This gift also reaches these girls at a critical time. <strong>90% of kids in America </strong>will form their <em>lifelong</em> values and beliefs... their FAITH... by their 13th birthday.

Surrounded by young girls becoming “physically” active by age 11, a high rate of “physical” abuse, and excessive immodesty Danet Panton-Fuller sensed great risk for her precious daughters: Zariah, Andazi, and Azariah. She wanted desperately for them to rise above the statistics of The Projects.
<div class="g2glarge">

<strong>Moms and daughters living in these poverty pockets are not able to purchase Secret Keeper Girl event tickets or books and resources to use as tools to reduce these risks. We feel called to find a way to bring them to them at no cost.</strong>

</div>
Having never met Danet, God’s Spirit spoke to me about this for the first time in 2011 and called us to do a free event in the Bronx and to give the moms who attended free books to help them disciple their girls in true beauty, modesty and purity.  Today, Danet’s daughters are passionately seeking God’s best for their life as they find their joy and strength in Jesus.

We are looking forward to writing more great stories like this one as we reach out to poverty-stricken regions all across the US. This year we are headed to poverty pockets in Belle Glade, FL, East Liverpool, OH, and Richmond, VA.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret Keeper Girl is the most fun a mom and daughter will have digging into God's word together! In a world where culture is targeting young girls with the pressures of growing up too fast, Secret Keeper Girl is a ministry dedicated to enabling moms to connect to their daughters and raise a generation of girls who love Jesus, know their value, and are ready to navigate culture with those things in mind. Secret Keeper Girl resources and live events are filled with fun activities, dance parties, fashion shows and more – all aimed at getting moms and daughters talking about Christ-centered definitions of true beauty and modesty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2002, Dannah Gresh wrote "Secret Keeper: The Delicate Power of Modesty." It soon became a handbook for the modesty movement across the nation, encouraging teen girls to keep the deepest secrets of their beauty for one man. But while raising her own daughter, Dannah realized that in today's culture TWEEN girls are being targeted with pressures that their mom's didn't face until high school.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wanting to keep her little girl from growing up too fast, she knew that she needed to instill the values of true beauty and modesty before those teen years. Mascara, spaghetti straps, training bras, and all the other danger zones of being a girl: Dannah gathered her daughter and her friends together for a Christ-centered, tween-friendly study on the topic of what it means to be a godly girl. This was the start of Secret Keeper Girl.</span></p>
<p class="p1">And as it turns out, a lot of moms are seeing their daughters face the pressure of growing up too fast! Since starting Secret Keeper Girl, Dannah Gresh has released more than 25 books for moms and their tweens, and Secret Keeper Girl live events have helped over 200,000 moms and daughters begin conversation about the deepest secrets of their beauty and value. Secret Keeper Girl has become the nation's number one tool for connecting moms and their tween daughters to each other and to Christ.</p>

Only He knew that the gracious owner of that RV would later offer to buy us a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/08txi9of5r2k274/AABBc0kHmqTQdfHKT_M6hmYxa?dl=0">BRAND-NEW BUS</a>! <img class="size-medium wp-image-6298 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4902-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4902" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the start of the Spring 2015 tour season, we were rolling with style in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/08txi9of5r2k274/AABBc0kHmqTQdfHKT_M6hmYxa?dl=0">beautiful gift of a bus we decided to name Providence so we always remember the Lord's hand in giving it to us</a>. The bus is our home-away-from-home and this new one is spacious and was newly renovated inside so it is super comfy! Stephanie, our wonderful bus driver, drives the team from city to city while they sleep in one of the 12 bunks onboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">**Be sure to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secretkeepergirl">follow us on Facebook</a> because on our days off, we love to have friends like YOU come and hang out with us on the bus!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #3: We blow up a lot of balloons each morning.</strong> Each event requires stage set up that takes us about 3 hours. No one gets the morning off. We all help set up lighting, sound equipment, staging pipe and drape, the resource table signs and banners, books, and lots and lots of balloons. The balloon sculptures for the stage take about an hour and require several volunteers from our host church (whom we love so much) managed by one team member who handles our 7' crazy hair column topper with expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons.png"><img class=" wp-image-4762 alignleft" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons-300x252.png" alt="Balloons" width="240" height="202" /></a>
<em>Last year we spent about 80 hours blowing up 17,760 balloons.</em></p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #5: We manage a lot of clothes and props backstage.</strong> From the world's largest chicken egg to a complete set of authentic vintage clothing from four different decades, our stage team manages all of its own props. We put them out in the morning and do a careful accounting of each item at the end of each night. Heather (vintage clothing coordinator) and Jordan ("It's Sew Crazy" tween fashion show designer) are seen below organizing one of our wardrobes from a former season.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4766 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n-300x225.jpg" alt="312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Crazy Hair Tour uses 111 props each night including the world's largest sling shot! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #6: Every day we do a sound check.</strong> The last thing we do before daily team devos and lunch is our sound check. We're usually excited by this point because it means we're almost to the part of the day that we get "off." From about noon to four we get to hang out in our bus home or get a shower in a local hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6865.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6301 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6865-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_6865" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The worship team having way too much fun during sound check! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #7: We eat at midnight.</strong> They say that being on stage for one hour is the equivalent of a 4 hour workout. Since we're on stage for nearly three hours, we are starving by the time the bus is loaded up and our pjs (comprised of sweat pants and sweat shirts) are on. We have been known to eat burgers the size of our heads (Lexi) and pizza no less worth talking about (Suzy) at midnight which is when we roll on out of one city and head to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger.png"><img class=" wp-image-4768 alignleft" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger-294x300.png" alt="Burger" width="283" height="288" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year our food budget was $11,799. (We eat less than the bus, that's for sure!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After our midnight snack, it's off to bed in our trusty tour bus. And on to the next city to do it all over again! Can't wait to see YOU this tour season!! ❤</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/crazyhair.php">Secret Keeper Girl stage team</a> recently had the awesome opportunity to join a group of mothers and daughters who are going through an ‘</span><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/search?q=8+great+dates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8 Great Dates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ book. The topic of the week - MEAN GIRLS. After introductions were made, the group discussion things progressed slowly as everyone was unsure of how honest and open they could be. But as our hearts opened up and the conversation picked up steam, we all learned three very important lessons from each other about friendship and mean girls.</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     1. We use the phrase “mean girls” all of the time, but could our frequent use of the term be causing us to miss other potentially toxic friendships that are all along the spectrum? Take the SKG team for example - to break the ice, each girl shared about her friendship experiences. Starting at the beginning of the line, we had the bully, who said mean things and acted in unkind ways while growing up. To her right was the girl who was neither a mean girl nor a bully; she just kind of got along with everyone. Up next was the girl who had been hurt by bullies. When she was growing up, she had all types of mean things said to her and didn’t have good friend. Lastly there was one more girl, who had a unique experience that isn’t often discussed. When she was younger, she found herself in a friendship she <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thought</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was good but really wasn’t. She was very young and so confused that even when she found herself lying to her mother about this girl, it didn’t register that the friendship wasn’t the best thing for her. Even though her friend wasn’t being a stereotypical “mean girl”, she certainly wasn’t being a good friend. All this to say, it’s important to focus on what makes a good friend and what doesn’t and not just “mean girls”.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">     2. Most of us are quite familiar with the quote “before you judge me, walk a mile in my shoes,” but how often do we teach our daughters to really do this? As our group talked, the girl who was was a bully shared that her meanness stemmed from having to experience a death in her family at a very young age. Another mom shared that her daughter had dealt with a bully and over time, it came out that the mean girl had a lot of difficulties in her life. Now please don’t think we’re saying that meanness is ok if someone has a sad enough excuse. No, those who are mean still have to take responsibility for their actions. What we're saying is that <em>a lot </em>of times, there is pain behind the meanness. Which leads us to say this... </span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     3. ‘Be holy’ (1 Peter 1:16)… Oh man, this is so good to talk about and it’s “easy” to do when things are great and you’re in the midst of a good friendship group. But what about when you’re the one being bullied at school? What about when it’s your feelings that are being hurt and it’s you or your daughter who comes home crying? What about when things get so bad that you or your child doesn’t even want to go to school? Yeah, that’s when the command to be holy as our Father is holy is like ‘really, Jesus? You ask way too much!’</span></li>
</ol>
Guess what? He DOES ask too much! But He never asks it without promising to help us by doing whatever He’s asking us to do <i>THROUGH </i>us! Loving your bully, praying for them, forgiving them is NOT easy and you know why? Because it’s NOT natural! It’s not normal. It’s supernatural. It’s CRAZY, something that <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/crazyhair.php">we are all about here at Secret Keeper Girl</a>! And it’s something that can ONLY be done with supernatural help and with through the Holy Spirit’s working in our hearts and minds. In friendships, holiness can take on many different forms; it all depends on what the Spirit is leading you to do, which is why it’s imperative to seek His face in times like these. Holiness could mean distancing yourself. The Bible says “make <em>every effort</em> to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.” (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>, NIV)  Sometimes to keep the peace, you need to distance yourself a la Lot and Abraham in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013">Genesis 13</a>. Holiness could also mean the Spirit leading you or your daughter to trying to befriend whoever is causing you trouble. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a> says “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you…” (KJV) It is so not <span style="font-weight: 400;">normal to “love", "bless", "do good to" or "pray for" </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone who is making your life hard, but by doing these things the Lord could soften the hearts of your bully, give you an opportunity to make a good friend, and maybe even lead them to Himself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a good friend and being involved in good friendships can happen in a myriad of ways. The bottom line </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be found in the latter part of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>. It’s written above. Did you catch it? “<em>...Without holiness no one will see the Lord</em>.” This is what life is all about for the believer - living in such a way so that people are seeing the Lord, people are seeing Jesus. It’s important to realize and remember that <strong>as Christ-followers </strong></span><strong><i>everything</i> about us, even our friendships, should simply be ways in which the world can <i>SEE JESUS</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Make efforts towards peace for Jesus. Be a good friend for Jesus. Love your bullies for Jesus. It’s not about us and it is all about Him.</span>

You hear names like Jacob and David more often than Jessica and Emily in after-school conversations? Is this a good thing, bad thing or is she just a tomboy?

Early dating relationships, teen sex without consequences and a constant diet of boy-crazines is marketed to our daughters through movies, television shows, books, music and advertising. You and I have to be countercultural if we are going to protect our little girls and teach them to approach guy-girl relationships in a holy and age-appropriate manner!

It is not innaproraite or uncommon for your daughter to have multiple guy friends; especially if she is a bit more "rough and tumble," preferring a ball to a ballet slipper! Mom, even as adults we can admit that guys are not as caddy, they don't hold grudges and just roll with the punches. Your daughter is befriending them for the same reasons you did!

Well monitored, co-ed play dates are certainly appropriate and can be beneficial to your daughter. But, somewhere between the ages of 8-12 something shifts. She goes from having a guy pal to wanting a boyfriend. Some might think it's cute for girls to have multiple <em>boyfriends</em> while they are in the 5th grade. However, if your daughter develops the pattern of "needing" a guy when she's eight or nine, she could be heading for multiple long-term relationships in her teen years. That's not wise. Let's help her stay off the boy-crazy train!

You can do this by carefully monitoring her friendships with boys. Listen closely as she talks about her guy friends and the fun they have together. When her heart begins to shift - and you will see it - that may be the time to redefine her friendships with boys. By no means does this include writing them off! It may just mean they don't need to be alone together to play video games. Rather than hanging out in your basement alone, you can send them with a group of friends to the park. Encourage friendships with girls who have similar interests.

Encourage your daughter's father and other men in her life to step up to be the ones she throws the ball with! Countless studies have proven that the more involved a father figure is, the less likely she is to engage in early dating relationships and sexual activity. Admonish Dad, Brother, Uncle, etc. to take her on a hike or bike ride, go fishing, play ball, attend a sporting event or fancy dinner.

Remain in close communication with your daughter about all of her friendships, especially those with boys. Ask her how she feels about herself, boys, and relationships. Then you get to respond to those emotions and direct them with more questions. Pray with your daughter for any guys in her life she considers her friend. Ask that God help her approach those relationships in ways that honor Him.

By the time a girl is eleven, 30% of her peers will have had a boyfriend. Since this drive to be in a relationship only escalates, it's important to talk to your daughter before it happens. If she is already at the "boyfriend" phase, read our <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/featured/how-do-i-talk-to-my-daughter-about-dating/">blog</a> on how to talk to her about dating.'

So many dresses today give off the not-so-little girl vibe. We want a look for our girls that says <em>sweet</em> and <em>innocent</em> rather than <em>growing up too fast</em>. However, many dresses that are little girl appropriate are often lack-luster when it comes to style.

Want to add some color to your dress? How about some bling? Adding simple embellishments can take your dress from dull to designer in a matter of minutes!

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_7744.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3494 aligncenter" alt="IMG_7744" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_7744-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Does your girl love rhinestones, sequins and bling? Help your daughter sew some along the hem of her dress or along the neckline for a touch of fancy. Is she funky and expressive? Let her pick out some themed buttons for a unique style spin.

This grey dress appears in the Secret Keeper Girl Crazy Hair Tour It's Sew Crazy Fashion Show. We felt it was a bit drab on its own so we added a collar of buttons!

It’s a BIG deal to be a girl! It’s a big deal to be a boy and that’s pretty cool, huh? Which leads up to number 2!</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. God created us male and </span><b><i>female</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reflect His image. (vs 27)
</span>The absolute best part of God’s design was Adam and Eve, man and woman. You may be wondering why God chose two different biological sexes to represent Him? How does being a boy or a girl help us reflect God’s image? That’s a big question so does everyone have their thinking caps on? Let’s dive in!
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that God is actually three distinctly different persons in one? Do you know Who they are? Yes, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, which is why He’s known as the trinity (“tri” means 3, incase you didn’t know, so He is 3 in 1.) The Hebrew word in the Bible for this unity of the trinity is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This word refers to marriage, when a man and a woman coming together in union reflects how God comes together in the trinity. Genesis 2:24 says that a man and a woman will become one (echad) flesh. A man and a woman are two distinctly different, independent humans, but when they come together, they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just like God the trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is heavy-duty brain food, but we think that you’re capable of handling it all!! ?</span></li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Looking like God is a </span><b><i>process</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (2 Corinthians 3:18)
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This verse says that we are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transformed to look more like God. We don’t come out already looking like God. It’s not just because you were born a girl that you look like God. And it’s not just once you get married that you’ll </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like God. We are still being made to look more and more like God as we follow Jesus. He started with the fact that you are a girl, and He continues working in your heart to reflect Him every day. Does anyone out there think that they are completely perfect in every single itty bitty way? No, none of us are perfect! We don’t look exactly like God because we’re human and humans have sin, but every day that we follow Jesus and learn more about how to be like Him, we become a better and better reflection of Him.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You start to look more and more like Jesus through praying, and studying His Word, by doing what He says, and by loving him in your heart. Being a girl is a GREAT reflection of Him. But don’t stop there! Be loving, and kind, and obedient. Sometimes this means cleaning your room when you would really just rather be watching TV, or choosing to be nice to someone at school who wasn’t nice to you. Reflect God well by being a GIRL who wants to be like JESUS.</span>
<blockquote>Prayer Time: <span style="font-weight: 400;">In what way(s) are you struggling to look like Jesus? Maybe it’s obeying your parents, or being nice at school. Maybe it’s lying or cheating on a test. Maybe it’s not trying to be like Jesus, or telling teeny tiny lies that you think you can get away with. Daughters, tell your moms the top #1 way that you struggle to be a reflection of God. Then, moms, take a minute to pray over your girls.</span>

Monthly Challenge: This assignment is all about making your girl’s heart beautiful aka making it more like Jesus'. This month I want you to celebrate being a girl with your daughter and her closest friends by doing our FREE mother-daughter Spring date.

If you joined us at the Secret Keeper Girl ‘Crazy Hair Tour’ you would remember the sound of 100’s of sweet little girls singing “Jesus Loves Me” with one voice as some made a first time commitment to Christ.

Since 2010, over 5,256 girls at Secret Keeper Girl events have come forward with their moms to commit their lives to Christ. [1] On average, a girl comes to Christ every 9 hours through Secret Keeper Girl. Every girl has a story. All of them precious-- just like this one.
<blockquote>Today my daughter had a bad day at school and then took the bad home with her to her sister and me. She cried and broke down. I... wanted to cry and break down! We decided to squeeze in Secret Keeper Girl tonight at the last minute. She mumbled on the way, "Today is the WORST day ever!" However, tonight at SKG, God led me to share the gospel with my daughter again. But this time was different! She got into the car and exclaimed, "This time I felt Him! Jesus is in my heart! Tomorrow's going to better because I have Jesus to help me!" As we drove home, she exclaimed, "This is the BEST day ever!” God has a way to make bad always turn to good! She cried! I cried! Today was the BEST day ever with my tween!</blockquote>
The reality is that nearly half of all Americans who accept Jesus Christ as their Savior do so before reaching the age of 13. What these girls “believe by their thirteenth birthday is generally what they will die believing” (Barna Research). [2] That’s why I’m so passionate to reach them before they conform to the new “normal” for 10 year-olds -- - push-up bras, sexy dolls, and mascara sales.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/frostine.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-7266"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7266 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/frostine-300x169.jpg" alt="frostine" width="300" height="169" /></a>The early sexualization of our little girls is totally out of control. For example, the average age of an eating disorder clinic patient has dropped from 15 to 10 and 66% of underweight girls think they’re fat. Even the toys you and I grew up with are getting sexy makeovers. Remember Princess Frostine from Candy Land? Well, look at her now.

&nbsp;

Research is clear that the greatest risk reducer for these girls is mother/daughter connectedness. Because of that, I’m excited to debut the all-new Secret Keeper Girl ‘<span style="color: #8600bb;">Purple Party Tour</span>’ on August 18th. The new show will be even more effective in equipping moms with proven tools to teach their girls the secrets of true beauty and biblical modesty and will cultivate more priceless moments between mom, daughter and Jesus.
<p style="text-align: left;">We’ll also teach girls a loving, biblical view of gender in a safe, age-appropriate manner. What could be more important during a summer when people are petitioning Disney to make Frozen’s beloved Elsa gay in an upcoming sequel? [3]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #8600bb;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Our work is crucial.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #8600bb;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Our “ask” is simple.</span></strong></span></p>
I really need your help to create opportunities for girls to hear truth at the Secret Keeper Girl ‘<span style="color: #8600bb;">Purple Party Tour</span>’. The cost of bringing a new show and curriculum to life is about $100,000. Our goal is to raise that by July 15th. Friends like you help girls experience pure freedom their whole lives as long as we teach them the secrets of true beauty and modesty.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>At nearly every event, people tell us, “If only this had been around when I was young I might not have known the hurts that I know.”</strong></h3>
Because of your faithfulness, Secret Keeper Girl has been there at the exact right time for more than 150,000 girls. Together, we can help them prevent the pain so many of us felt for far too long. I’m asking you to walk alongside us to reach even more moms and daughters with the message of Pure Freedom. Here are some specific ways to help.

Look any and just about everywhere and you will see a huge debate over how girls should be girls. Girl who are girly girls, tomboys, and those who are a fabulous mix of both, are often ridiculed by peers and society. There are a lot of opinions out there BUT what does God, the one who has the first and last say in everything actually have to say? We spent our last Girl Gab Bible Study diving into His Word because it has some pretty cool and important things to say about girls and why no matter if they .... they are all His masterpieces who reflect His glory.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have your daughter open her Bible to Genesis 1 and read verses 26-31. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. You were created in God’s <i>image</i> and that’s very good! (vs 31)
</span>According to verse 31, you weren’t created in the image of your mother, father, or grandparents, regardless of whose nose you might spot on the front of your face. You were created in the image of GOD, and He says that is “very good”. It might be because we make God visible or known (we glorify Him) by looking like Him. We were created IN HIS IMAGE to GLORIFY Him. The Bible talks about a very specific way that we glorify Him, and it’s awesome. See, we have all kinds of talents and skills — from being able to play sports to singing well to being very good at art — but the best way for us represent the wonder of God and look like Him is through our roles as male and female. It’s a BIG deal to be a girl! It’s a big deal to be a boy and that’s pretty cool, huh? Which leads up to number 2!

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. God created us male and <i>female</i> to reflect His image. (vs 27)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn on the television, scroll on any social media site, open any magazine and you’ll see it. You may even feel it. The pressure circulating females today is palpable. We are expected to look a certain way, dress a certain way, speak a certain way - it’s maddening! With all of these opposing and oftimes off-base opinions screaming, “come over this way and join us!”, it’s no wonder that your tween may feel a little odd at times as she struggles to find out who she is and why God created her the way she is. The confusion sometimes goes deep! From the ages of 9-16, I knew I was a female who was made in the image of God, and that I was a child of God because I’d accepted Jesus as my Savior. I loved being a girl but because I was taller than all of my class (boys included), more muscular than all my girlfriends, wasn’t dainty, and didn’t have a huge interest in “girly” things, I felt very out of place and confused about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to be </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a girl. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What about your tween daughter? Is she a glitz-loving girly girl? How about a football-chasing tomboy? Both of these groups may be ridiculed by their peers and society, but we want to talk about why God thinks BOTH (as well as all the girls in between) are awesome! Whether she prefers to run around with dirt under her fingernails or she loves to hit the nail salon with you or friends, her preference matters to God. Whether she prefers to play with dinosaurs and trucks over dolls and tea sets, there is something God can use in those separate interests. Whether she loves to play dress up like Princess Anna or like Batman, God wants to use that imagination for His glory and honor. Whether she dreams of being a marine biologist, a mother, the president, or a librarian, God has something special and unique for her to do that no one else can do! </span>

In a recent focus group, 76% of moms said their tween daughters struggle to obey authority while 97% of those daughters admitted they struggle to obey.  Virtually all of our tween girls are struggling to prize an attitude of respect in our “here’s a blue ribbon for showing up” and “you totally deserve that pricey frappuccino” culture.  Don’t get us wrong, we think being a strong girl is awesome! So during our last <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girlgab.php">SKG Girl Gab Mother/Daughter Bible study</a>, we looked at the story of Abigail to learn how to be BOTH strong and humble. It's Girl Power God's Way!

Have your daughter open her Bible to 1 Samuel 25 and read verses 1-13, 18-20, and 23-28.

	<li><strong>1. Jesus is the <em>King</em> of <em>Kings</em> and the Lord of Lords!</strong> (Revelation 19:16)
Now what does this have to do with being a daughter of the King? Well everything, really! Jesus is THE King. He's not just <em>a </em>king or one of many kings, but THE King. He's the number one ruler!</li>

	<li><strong>2. We are God’s <em>children</em>. He predestined us for <em>adoption</em>. Since Jesus is the King of Kings, and we are His adopted daughters, that makes us <em>princesses</em>. </strong>(Romans 8:15-17 and Ephesians 1:4-5)
If you have A. admitted that you are a sinner, have B. believed that only Jesus can save you from your sin [because He lived a perfect life, died in your place to pay the penalty for your sin, and rose again on the third day], and have C. confessed that Jesus is the King and that you want to be in His family, guess what? You ARE a Princess, daughter of the real-live King! Yes, this is awesome! You are a daughter of the King! But there's a catch.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>3. I am not <em>my own</em>.</strong>  (1 Corinthians 6:19)</li>
	<li>Remember if you're a daughter of the King, you get to belong to THE King! So yes, you are a Princess but you are not the one on the throne. Jesus is and we submit our lives to His authority. And we submit to the authority that God has placed over us. This is hard one but if we can't submit to the authority over our lives, we won't submit to Jesus either. Jesus placed us in families so that we can learn how to live out Ephesians 5:21, which says 'submit to one out of reverence to Christ'. And He know this is super hard but He has promised to help us with this!</li>

<blockquote>MONTHLY CHALLENGE - This is not easy so PRACTICE living as if your life is not your own. Choose a slot of time in which you are usually free to do whatever you want (maybe right after school or when your homework is completed). Instead of using that time to focus on yourself, use it to meet a need of someone in your home. Here are a few options (or choose your own):
1. Offer to cook dinner one evening. Encourage your parents to spend the time they would have spent cooking and cleaning doing something that helps them relax.
2. Take your younger brother or sister outside for some play time. Let them pick the game and they play until you’re both worn out. For extra credit, allow a friend of your brother or sister’s hang out too.
3. Spend 30 minutes in prayer for someone in need. Don’t use this prayer time to make requests for yourself. Concentrate your prayer efforts on the needs of someone else.</blockquote>

With programs like Toddlers and Tiaras and reality shows where sass and diva-ness is applauded and laughed at, it's no wonder that many struggle with raising daughters who aren't brats. Now you may be thinking, 'nope! That's not my little girl!' If that's true, awesome, but let's ask you a question - does your daughter act like no one can tell her what to do? Like she's in charge of her own life?

If the answer is yes, you're not alone. In one of our recent focus groups, 76% of moms said their tween daughters struggle to obey authority while 97% of those daughters admitted they struggle to obey. <span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">Virtually all of our tween girls are struggling to prize an </span>attitude of respect in our “here’s a blue ribbon for showing up” and “you totally deserve that pricey frappuccino” culture. Don’t get us wrong, we think being a strong girl is awesome! In fact, throughout the Bible God repeatedly uses super strong ladies to do super important things. Let’s take a look at the biblical example of Abigail and learn how to do girl power God’s way with both strength and respect.

Welcome to 2016, moms! With so many social media dangers and apps like Snapchat and Instagram, it’s so hard to know when/if your child should even have a phone and if she does, where is the line? Ah the great debate and while we hear you, we think the debate should go beyond should my child have a cell phone or not. If you decide to not give your child a phone, great! But if you do (that’s wonderful!), have you set your daughter up so she knows how to handle the device in a mature and healthy way?

Your daughter had to be taught how to properly tie and wear her shoes, right? Well in the same way, she must be taught how to use electronic devices in a mature and healthy way. Children can’t do what they haven’t been taught to do, so during our last SKG Girl Gab Mother/Daughter Bible study, we went "Online with Eve" to learn 5 truths about self-control your daughter needs to know so she can handle electronics wisely.

Have your daughter open her Bible to Genesis 3 and read verses 1-13 and 20-21.
<ol>
	<li><strong>1. Everything God made is <em>good</em></strong>. (Genesis 1:31)</li>
	<li>The tree of knowledge of good and evil that Eve and her husband, Adam, ate from was good because God created it and <em>everything</em> God has created is good. Think about all the things that make up cell phones or tablets or television screens. God created the brains that developed the internet. He made the materials that make up cell phones. He made the air and sound waves upon which radio and television pictures travel to our electronic devices. The internet, media, and electronics <em>can be </em>used for good things and maybe the thing that is tempting you is actually a good thing, which leads us to #2.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>2. </strong><strong>Satan is a <em>liar</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:1; John 8:34)</li>
	<li>Depending on what version of the Bible you're reading, Genesis 3:1 may say Satan was "crafty" which means, Satan is untruthful and sneaky. John 8:34 names Satan as the 'Father of All Lies,' meaning all lies come from him. So Satan will take something is good and has a good purpose and lie to us about its purpose so that we are tempted to do bad things with it. Satan twisted what God said and made Eve think that God was withholding something good from her. In the same way, Satan's lies can make us feel like we will miss out on something or like we won't be considered cool if we follow God's way.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>3. </strong><strong>Eve had to make a decision to be <em>God-controlled</em> by being <em>self-controlled</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:4)</li>
	<li>Self-control is actually a fruit of the Spirit, meaning it comes from God. He gives us the ability to control ourselves so if we don't have God helping us, we can't have self-control. Eve had a decision to make - whether she was going to believe Satan, the liar, or believe God and use His help to control herself. We too have to decide whether we're going to let media and television control us or whether we're going to use God's help, His Spirit, to have control over us.</li>
	<li><strong>4. Giving into <em>temptation</em> always leads to a <em>situation</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:6-7)</li>
	<li>Temptation leads you to a place where instead of feeling good or comforted, you feel naked and ashamed like Eve did when God came to find her. But the good news is found in #5...</li>
	<li><strong>5. God will <em>comfort</em> you if you don’t keep <em>hiding</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:21)</li>
	<li>Adam and Eve had to come out and let God see them. Once they revealed themselves, God gave them fur coats (or garments of skins), which means He clothed them. He comforted them.</li>
</ol>
Girls and moms, we all face temptation, things that tease us into doing the wrong thing. But with God's help, we can all choose to be self-controlled. And when we mess up, when we give into temptation, we can also choose to come out of hiding. Daughters, if you're hiding something, if you've done something or looked at something you know you weren't supposed to, don't stay silent any longer. Come out! Tell God, tell your mom. They may give you consequences - which are really for your good -  but they will also give you comfort through their love and forgiveness.

Let's admit one thing: it's not unusual to want to be loved!

Every person on earth has a deep desire to be loved. While we girls may endure an especially pronounced craving for it, love is a basic need of humanity. Guys just don't tend to act as needy for us as we act for them. And that's where some of our woundedness begins. We think they can fix our hearts. They know they can't, so they get annoyed when we expect them to at least try.

Once during a difficult season of feeling unloved and craving violently for my husband to fix it, I cried out to God with the guttural pleading of the deeply wounded. In complete desperation, I began a journey of praying through my need, which led me to Proverbs 19:22, and I encourage you to start your own journey to true love with this same verse. It reads:
<blockquote>What a man desires is unfailing love;
better to be poor than a liar.
(Proverbs 19:22, NIV)</blockquote>
That verse was like a healing balm to my heart. It gave me permission to be love crazy! It said to me, "Dannah, let's just put it out there: everyone has a deep desire to be loved. Don't lie about it. Just say it like it is: I want to be loved!"

If you and your teen daughter have been to our Pure Freedom Teen Tour, you know all about our Love Feast. If you haven't, first - grab your teen girl (and any teen girls and their moms who you know) and come see us! Details are further down in this email. Second, let me explain the Love Feast. It's a ten day experience that we want your teen daughter to join...no guys, just God.

The salve for your daughter's deep craving will not be found in white-knuckling her way out of boy-craziness. It won't be found in legalistically "fasting from guys" without feeding her true need for love. It's not going to work for her to deny her deep and genuine desire. The best place for her to begin is to verbally spiritually express a deep truth: I need love!

You see, God alone holds the answer to our deep craving for love. He is our Source. Tell your daughter to give it a try. <strong>Let her be love crazy</strong>!

For your daughter to <a href="http://purefreedom.org/love-feast/">join our Love Feast</a>, she only needs to do two things.
She'll need to grab her copy of <em><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/get-lost-your-guide-to-finding-true-love">Get Lost</a></em>. If she doesn't have it, not to worry! We have a special <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/get-lost-book-t-shirt-gift-pack">February Love Feast Pack</a> just for her below.

She needs to <a href="http://purefreedom.org/love-feast/">register at this link</a>. Starting March 1, 2016 we'll keep in touch with her via email daily with direction and encouragement as she learns to feast on God's love.
We hope your girl will join us!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom, you send us emails all the time asking for advice. From questions about friends, siblings, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues with self-entitlement to boys and puberty, we’re happy we get to offer you biblically sound and practical help. We recently received the following email from an SKG mom and are wondering if this resonates with you: </span>
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend, our tween had a few girlfriends say over at our house - and they all stayed on their phones almost the entire time! Instead of simply playing games and engaging with each other, the entire night was documented with pictures and videos, all of which were immediately uploaded to Instagram. From then on, any dialogue was about whose picture or video received the most views and likes. Later, I overheard an Instagram video of a girl who, finding out about the get together online, was upset at not being invited to the party. I was totally speechless and taken by surprise! I mean, what ever happened to girls going to each other’s houses to chat, giggle, and play games?</span></i></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Whatever happened to that? Welcome to 2016, moms! With so many social media dangers and apps like Snapchat and Instagram, it's so hard to know when/if your child should even have a phone and if she does, where is the line? While we hear you, we think the debate should go beyond should my child have a cell phone or not. If you decide to not give your child a phone, great! But if you do (that's wonderful!), PLEASE make sure your instructions go beyond telling her how the functions work and when she can/can't use the phone.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Torres* family is an incredibly courageous group with deeply wounded hearts and the most basic of needs. The mother was widowed by the tragic suicide of her husband, whose body was discovered in their living room by his daughters [aged 16, 15, 13, 8, and 6]. To say that this left an emotional scar on their precious hearts is inaccurately miniaturized. This has set the family in a dark place of poverty and hopelessness. The children are in tears frequently as they face the daily hunger of poverty. This family is crying out for the most basic of needs – food, protection, love. (*Name has been changed)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This past fall, a very talented teen musician named Heather* started her first year as a drum major for the marching band. She was a fierce leader even before becoming drum major, standing out as the only girl on the drumline. She took full advantage of this position by befriending and inspiring other girls to get involved with music. Heather’s mom glowed with pride and supported her daughter by becoming very active with the other band parents. Her first year as a drum major should have been filled with joy, exciting challenges, and memory-makers, but these ‘should have been’s’ were confronted with a harsh reality early this year. Heather’s mom had already beaten breast cancer when Heather was just a baby, but tragically found out she had developed advanced throat cancer mere months before Heather stepped into her new role. Heather’s mom’s chemotherapy has kept her from watching her daughter march, and as the cancer ravages her body, the family is unsure of how much time she has left. They’re longing to make this year’s holiday season a memorable one. (*Names have been changed)</span>

On December 1, 2015 (#GivingTuesday), help us raise $10,000 <strong>and</strong> become one of 50 new Girl to Girl (G2G) members who will partner with us in ministry and help us reach more families like Heather’s with Jesus’ love.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica* and her 10 year old daughter, Rachel*, are an all-American military family and as such they have to be separated for long seasons of deployment and various military trainings. They have had to adjust and work at being flexible in ways that should never be asked of a mother and daughter. Thankfully, Rachel is blessed with loving family members who love to have her stay with them when her mother is away serving our country - but there is nothing quite like being cared for by your own mother. Unfortunately, Rachel has never met her father.  We want to send Rachel a #SKGPinkBox this Christmas to help her find a beautiful relationship with her Heavenly Father, and pursue His heart for purity and modesty. (*Names have been changed)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chloe* joined the surrounding tweens in laughter and music at a Secret Keeper Girl show just over a month ago.  While all of the the crazy fun and colorful balloons lifted her spirits, the glowing smile on her face faded as she lay in her hospital bed that night. Chloe is a beautiful 13 year old who lives at a hospital because she suffers from severe depression, anxiety, and extending physical ailments which have been complicated by an eating disorder. Looking on the outside one would never know the depth of Chloe’s distress, but on the inside her heart and soul are screaming in pain. Her father abandoned her and her mother when Chloe was just a baby. It’s an absence that has always been felt, but as Chloe ventures into her teenage years the lack of fatherly love and support is mighty. She struggles with hating herself for not being enough for her father to stay. Her mother does everything she can to support and provide for her, but steady employment has been hard to come by with her daughter in the hospital. Chloe’s mom has her own depth of physical and emotional pain to overcome, and she is doing her very best to be strong for her daughter. With the father’s lack of financial and emotional child support and their own minimal income, Chloe and her mother could use a practical gift of love. (*Names have been changed)</span>

The <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php" target="_blank">Secret Keeper Girl to Girl</a> fund exists to be able to hear a need and respond to it on the spot! Through your Girl to Girl donations, a myriad of cries from families and children have been heart and met. Here is a special story that is close to our hearts…

In June 2015, <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php" target="_blank">Secret Keeper Girl to Girl (G2G)</a> provided funding for life-saving medical treatment and transportation for a little boy in Haiti named Pierre. Without access to proper medical treatment, Pierre developed a life threatening medical condition that doctors are currently working to fully diagnose. His local doctors lacked access to necessary medical equipment and nutritional formulas for him but your generosity helped to deliver him into safe hands. He is still fighting malnourishment, dehydration, partial paralysis and uncontrollable movements of some limbs among other things but his condition is improving with proper medical attention and proper nutrition, and we are praising the Lord for his continued improvement.
<blockquote>
<h3>"Thanks to you, Dannah, and your entire team. You’re buying us time, and you’re buying his momma hope."
– Pastor who is facilitating Pierre’s treatment in Haiti</h3>
</blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year a very special <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> (G2G) partner named Julie inspired our hearts and did something that we will never forget.  As the single mother of a beautiful tween she realized the immense blessings God had bestowed upon her and decided to BE a blessing. She reached out to the <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> family on behalf of a single mom who had escaped an abusive relationship with her tween and was now living with her until she could get back on her feet. One of the biggest hurdles Julie faced was saving a storage facility that held all of her houseguest's belongings (school pictures, Christmas stockings, and priceless memories) that was set to be auctioned off. Julie contacted us, and we were able to use donations from the <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> fund to rescue everything they had just two weeks before auction! We were able to make Christmas morning very special for these two families as we even got to surprise them with checks and special presents. Julie’s reaction will fill your heart with joy.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you all for the amazing Christmas blessings!...Thank you for the amazing way you minister to our hearts and the hearts of our daughters, for the way you show Jesus’ love in practical ways…[you have] changed our lives... I still haven’t found the right words to express the love and gratitude we are feeling. For some people this check would be a nice bonus. For us, it was a</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>game changer</strong>.”</span></i></h3>
</blockquote>
Give a gift that could change things tremendously for a family in need this Christmas. On #GivingTuesday this <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2009456685"><span class="aQJ">December 1</span></span>, we want to raise $10,000 and get 50 new Girl to Girl (G2G) members who will partner with us in ministry and help us reach more families with Jesus’ love.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer 2015 was a weird one for me. It was filled with lessons and growth which led to very frustrating freedom. Sounds like an oxymoron, right? Well, let me explain - for the first time in my life, I actually enjoyed being in my own skin this past summer and it was awesome! I've had had a long, long journey (which I am still on) in learning to love how I was fashioned and formed by God. I have had to learn to accept that I have a naturally bigger framework and curves in what I think are peculiar places. One of my biggest insecurities comes from having grown so quickly when I was a child. When I was born, doctors told my parents I would be in the 90th percentile of height, weight, and growth for kids my age. The result of growing too fast for my skin? Stretch marks - and I have always <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hated</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them! I never wore anything that would show my skin, including shirts with sleeves higher than your typical t-shirt sleeve length because of my marks. But it was hard to be a part of our campaign be around our newest books <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><i>It’s Great to Be A Girl</i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/new-stuff/products/raising-body-confident-daughters"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising Body Confident Daughters</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” without hearing The Spirit speaking to my heart about my body insecurities. The Lord worked on my heart and eyes and helped me to start seeing what He saw in me, and helped </span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">me become comfortable with all the things that make me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including my stretch marks.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With my new found comfortableness in ‘this is me, my body, and I love it’ and my always increasing confidence thanks to working out (oh yeah, endorphins!), I was ready to venture into new fashion territory… (read as "things that showed off just a little bit of skin"). Only I couldn’t in good conscience. Freedom immediately followed by frustration! </span></span></span></span>

<iframe class="giphy-embed" src="//giphy.com/embed/93rI3szziYMYo" width="248" height="248" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand I knew God was healing my view of myself. He was giving me confidence. So why couldn’t I wear what I wanted to wear? If I’m proud of my body now and thankful for what He’s done in it and with it, what’s the big deal with wearing certain things?’ Can you relate? Frustrating freedom is what I felt and to be honest, The Spirit and I battled with this for a few weeks as both my flesh and my spirit were in it to win it. Have you ever been here? What would you do? What have you done?
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the Lord made it very simple. Not easy but simple. I have an immediate authority over me in the form of my job and bosses. How could I wear something that I get on stage and encourage girls every single night <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to wear. God told me this: I can’t rebel against the authority that He’s placed over my life without rebelling against Him. It just doesn’t work that way. We can’t pick and choose the ways in which we </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obey God. Either we obey fully or we don’t at all.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if I didn’t work for Secret Keeper Girl? What if the school doesn’t have a dress code? What if friends and family around you are shouting ‘there is freedom in Christ!’? Well, yeah there most definitely is. But God took things a bit further for me and I remembered a concept that Secret Keeper Girl co-creator Dannah Gresh discussed in our </span><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mother/Daughter ‘Moonwalking’ Date</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. [BTW: Moms, truth is truth and applicable for us no matter what our age or situation. I don’t even have kids, yet God is always teaching me something from the resources we make available for you and your daughters. I hope </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are taking advantage.] The moonwalking date was not a contest to see who could do the best <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/michael-jackson-moonwalk-Dk1eDBR6mhakE">Michael Jackson impersonation</a> (which would be awesome) </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>but rather about ‘glory'. <strong>Who or what am I glorifying when I wear or <i>don’t</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> wear certain things?</strong> This was a hard question to swallow and it was kind of tricky for my mind to wrap itself around because I just wanted to celebrate and bask in my confidence and how great I was feeling as I took care of the body GOD had blessed me with! </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like something a good Christian girl would think and want to do, right? </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh my friends, so many of us get tripped up in this! Being good for goodness sake or so others will think you are a good Christian means nothing to the Lord. Being good, yeah it looks great on the outside - we say the right things, wear the right things, go to the right places. But may The Spirit always remind us that God is not interested in goodness. His heart's desire is that we be holy. Holiness, because it is about the heart and a person's motivations, always takes things a bit further. Pursuing His holiness means acting solely in the interest of only one person - Jesus Christ. Period. See, on the surface it sounded like I wanted to give God a shout-out as I chose certain clothes, but beneath, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted to be seen. I wanted to show off </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my</span></i></span><i> </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard work. I wanted to show how much </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had grown. There was a deeper lesson for me to learn and God wanted me not only to understand that lesson but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">live and act differently</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a result.</span> <strong>God does things in and through my body <i>not</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> for me but for Him</strong>. Always! He’s concerned about His glory and His name. And the only way to truly please Him is to get on board with His agenda. It’s not about us. Even down to what we do or even do not wear - it’s never about us. And let me tell you, any frustration that comes along with living with His glory in mind (because it <em>does</em> come!) is <strong>totally</strong> worth the gifts of joy, freedom, and intimacy with Him He gives as blessings for obeying Him. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the next time your daughter wants to wear something or do something, even if the reasoning seems good, ask the Holy Spirit to take your mind and heart deeper into holiness. Ask your daughter if what she is thinking about wearing is going to show off God or herself? We believe that is God’s heart concerning modesty and we desire to follow His line of thinking. Also remember that it’s important to pursue complete holiness in the motivations of our hearts. What are your (or your daughter’s) motivations for <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wearing certain things? Is it so God will be honored or so you’ll be seen as a "good Christian girl (or woman)"? You see, it goes both ways and the issue is always where is your heart because either you’re for God’s glory or against it. It’s plain and simple - not easy, but simple. </span></span>
<h4>Share below - Have you ever been frustrated with being modest? How did you handle it?</h4>

A healed and whole mom is equipped to raise pure girls. Conversely, a mom who is unhealed and unwhole will struggled to mentor her girls. We want you moms to walk in spiritual wellness and healing so you can be a truly amazing mother but also so you can be a phenomenal and whole woman of God! That woman who is brimming with spiritual power and life is the type of woman Jesus died to give you freedom to be!

Let's remind you of the truths we learned <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/featured/questions-you-never-want-your-daughter-to-ask/">last week</a>.
<blockquote>Psalm 25:14 (KJV) reads “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will shew them His covenant.</blockquote>
The secret of the Lord are “the people of God who are friends." The Hebrew language describes these people as a <strong>tight-knit group of intimate friends among whom weaknesses, strengths, successes, and failures are shared. Within this circle sins are confessed an<img class="  wp-image-6213 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/o-2-WOMEN-FRIEND-TALKING-facebook-300x150.jpg" alt="o-2-WOMEN-FRIEND-TALKING-facebook" width="370" height="185" />d forgiven</strong>. It's a place where masks of perfection are removed and there is no fear of telling our stories because everyone is <strong>truly known</strong>. <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">The Secret of The Lord</a> is all about living in intimate and open community with fellow believers as you are honest about your dreams, failures, past sins, and goals. We invite start your journey today! Below you'll find the first 3 steps to take toward your spiritual healing as you enter into the secret of the Lord.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step One: Pray</span>
Ask the Lord to help you identity the person you should ask to join you in the secret of the Lord. Often our minds rush to friends or obvious relationships. While the whole idea behind the secret of the Lord is having a <i>group</i> of people who walk in spiritual intimacy with you, it’s often wise to first connect to someone who can mentor you for a while before you begin to open up to peers. God may have chosen someone for you who is not in your immediate circle of influence or who isn’t an obvious match. It may be someone you never imagined so just sit quietly and ask the Lord to give you some names to consider.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Two: Select</span>
Choose someone you know and see often. We really want you to find at least one ongoing relationship where you can grow in spiritual intimacy. That’s not going to happen if you confess to someone who you don’t see all the time. Sometimes confessing to someone you’ll never see again helps you build confidence but that’s not going to help you enter into the secret of the Lord. If you select someone who doesn’t run in your circle, be ready to reconfigure your life to create frequent contact. Select someone who is an older, wiser advisor who will have some perspective that you don’t yet have. Unless you are confessing to your husband, the person you choose should be a woman.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Three: Renounce</span>
Speak out against your past mistakes and sin in the presence of your friend. Once you’ve figured out who to talk to, ask her to set aside some private time to help you talk through some issues and simply let it spill out. After you have spent some time sharing and hearing her advice, be sure to apply the truth of 2 Corinthians 4:2, which says, “We have to <i>renounce</i> secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyman’s conscience in the sight of God.”

The Greek word for the word <i>renounce</i> is <i>apeipon</i>, which means “to speak out against.” So sit down with your new confidant - your first taste of the secret of the Lord - and speak out! Pray out loud in power and authority. Confless. Claim healing. Renounce!

You can’t even imagine how good it’s gonna feel! Ladies, this is the most painful part of entering into the secret of the Lord, but don’t miss it! Adventure and more importantly freedom awaits! A great aid to going through this journey is to go through it with a friend. We don’t want you to let the fear of going through this alone stop you. So we have a <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">BOGO deal</a>, buy one book for yourself, get one for a friend for FREE!! Grab her by the hand and you take these steps toward spiritual healing and abundant living together, in Jesus’ name!

<p style="text-align: left;">Moms, the heart and desires you have for your children are known. We hear you. We see you. The resources we provide are based off of those prayers you pray during the middle of the night as you think about your babies. During those prayers, does your mind ever travel to a deeply hurtful and dark place; a place where you pray to God your daughter never, ever goes near. Are there secrets in your past? Are there things about your life that you pray your children never ask you about. Guess what? You're not alone. We have those places too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Unless we sense that we belong to each other with masks off, the vibrant church of today will become the powerless church of tomorrow.” Larry Crabb</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did something tug in your heart as you read over the word "masks"? That mask you have on tries to convince you that you look as good and are as happy as everyone else but truthfully, you feel as if you're dying on the inside. You’re feeling so lonely and broken and feel totally unknown and the enemy has caused you to believe these lies. Your mask is an isolating barrier that leads to a lack of spiritual power in your life.</p>
Moms, listen. Spiritual power is directly related to your own spiritual health. A physically sick person has a hard time getting up and helping other people, right? Well, the same is true of spiritually sick or weak person. But as you heal, the better you can lead and teach your own children. Having the Holy Spirit alive and active in your life is imperative as you train your children up in God’s way. He’s vital in transforming you into woman, wife, mother that is after His heart.

John 10:10 says that Jesus came that we may <i>have life and have it to the full</i>. <b>Do you know this abundant life? </b>What’s your spiritual pulse like? Are you living in the great adventure and miracles of God? Or are you closer to living in a spiritual coma? Do you long for something more. . . something deeper?

The psalmist King David wrote a powerful prescription for the masked perfection and powerlessness believers are experiencing today.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 25:14 (KJV) reads “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will shew them His covenant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">In it’s most literal translation, the secret of the Lord would be “the people of God who are friends.” It’s us. It’s you. And the Hebrew language describes these people as a <strong>tight-knit group of intimate friends among whom weaknesses, strengths, successes, and failures are shared. Within this circle sins are confessed and forgiven</strong>. Our masks of perfection are removed and there is no fear of telling our stories. We are truly known. The secret of the Lord is the intimate friendship that exists between believers.</p>
We want you to have the power of the secret of the Lord unleashed in your life. It’s real! It’s life-changing! It’s reviving and it’s the door to spiritual power! We encourage you to start practicing the secret of the Lord intimacy today!! First give that tug you feel in your heart to Jesus, right now. Then ask Him to give you courage to call up your best friend and ask her to join you in reading through <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo"><em>The Secret of The Lord</em></a>! There is a <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">BOGO deal</a> happening : buy a book for yourself, get a book for your friend for FREE [coupon code: JULYSECRET]!!!

This is the big one, mom! The conversation everyone wants a book to help with.

Basically all Christian psychologists and family experts out there all agree that the big <strong>sex</strong> talk needs to take place much earlier than we, as parents, are generally comfortable having it. What happens if you wait? Jimmy Hester, founder of True Love Waits and editor of the biblically based Christian Sex Education says that  “By ten or eleven years, many children who have not received adequate instructions about the facts of sexuality become disturbed and worry about what is real. They usually have heard bits and pieces of facts from peers.” [Jimmy Hester, ed Christian Sex Education (Lifeway, Nashville; 1995), 42.] Moms, you’ve got to begin to have the conversation about sexuality when your daughter is between the ages of six and ten. This devo will help you initiate this conversation.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Read John 16: 21. Does having a baby hurt? (Answer: Yes. It’s a lot of work for a body to do.) Does a mother remember the pain? (Answer: No. She forgets it and only remembers the joy. You might explain how this has been lived out in your own life.)</li>
	<li>2. How are you feeling about getting your period in the next few years?  (Answers will vary. Help her focus on the positive gift of her cycle.)</li>
	<li>3. Do you have any more questions about how your body creates life? (This is important whether you have or have not already had the sex talk. It may be the prompt she needs to ask what she’s really thinking. If you have had the talk, it may make her feel comfortable asking questions about it. You want to be the authority on all things related to gender and sex so make sure she knows she can ask anything at any time.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Chocolate Date Location Ideas</b>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Factory
</span>Visit a small chocolate boutique or a large chocolate factory and learn about chocolate. Be sure to enjoy taste-testing. Take a bag home to share with dad.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Fondue at a Restaurant
</span>Restaurants like The Melting Pot have killer fondue. Just make sure to make a reservation as it you can wait for pro-longed periods of time if you do not.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Campfire
</span>If the weather is nice, you could consider lighting up a camp fire and making S’mores for this date. Here’s my tip for the world’s best S’more. Find a clean rock and place it near the heat of the fire. Put your graham cracker and chocolate on the rock so the chocolate warms and softens while you are roasting your marshmallow. Be careful it doesn’t turn to liquid chocolate. Yummmm!

As you're bringing up your tween, you're probably starting to notice something - 'hygiene isn’t easy to talk about or teach biblically, simply because there’s not a lot about practical cleansing in the Bible. (There’s much more on ritual cleansing.) But, one thing stands true: your body is a holy temple for the living God of our the universe. Your daughter needs to know this. Her body is a temple of the living God—His dwelling place. And if God is living in [her] body, then it should be cared for better than the Taj Mahal.' So without further ado, here's devo #4 : a "body boosting" bubble bath!

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>A bubble bath

<i>Subject:</i> Hygiene

<i>Setting Options:</i> a Jacuzzi tub at a hotel, grandmas or your own house

<i>Materials You’ll Need:</i>

• Reservations at a hotel, or resort, or grandmas. You might also just plan to do this at your own home.

•A “body boost” gift bag or basket full of hygiene products such as deodorant, shampoo, a razor, and body wash.

<ol>
	<li>1. Read I Corinthians 3:16,17. What does it call your body? (Answer: A temple.) A temple is a place where God lives, so that means God’s Spirit is living in you. How does that make you feel? (Answers will vary.)</li>
	<li>2. Does God’s Spirit live in everyone? (Answer: No. He lives in those who have asked Christ to be the Lord of their life. If you or your daughter have not made this decision scroll down to find the 'The A, B, C’s of Becoming A Christian'.)</li>
	<li>3. If God is living in us, what does that say about how we should care for our bodies? (Answers will vary: we should clean them, provide nutrition, avoid putting harmful substances in them, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Body Boost Gift Basket
</b>Create a fun basket for your daughter that includes items she’ll use in her bubble bath, but also on a regular basis from this day forward. Be sure to include what she’s ready for, but not things she doesn’t yet need. For example, a nine year old may not need acne medication just yet. Hold off on that and maybe just buy her a simple facial cleanser.

<b>The A, B, C’s of Becoming a Christian</b>

Lots of people say they are Christians, but I am fairly convinced that many of them are not. What a sad thing to think that going to church, being good, or calling yourself a Christian would be your ticket to heaven all the while never having actually chosen to follow Jesus Christ in obedience. Jesus himself said he was the only way to heaven. John 14:6 reads: “Jesus said ..., “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Becoming a Christian is not difficult, but many are confused or distracted by things and actions that do not make them any more a Christian than walking on all fours makes me a dog!

<b>A—Admit you are a sinner.</b> A person must start with the confession that she has sinned. She must be both sorry for her sin and willing to stop. It doesn’t matter if it is fighting with your siblings, cheating on a test or—moms—cheating on your taxes or fighting with your siblings! Sin separates us from God. Because he is so perfect and holy, we cannot be in the presence of uncleansed sin. Romans 3:23 says “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” There’s that word again—glory. We cannot reflect God’s image if there is sin in us. And this verse say’s we’re all guilty.

<b><i>If you know you have sinned, pause to verbally confess your sin to Him right now.</i></b>

<b>B—Believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that his death on the cross was payment for all your sins.</b> You may be familiar with John 3:16. That beloved, worn out but never weary Bible verse reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” What kind of love is that? That God would sacrifice his only son so that we can live with him. He so wants you to be a Christian because he loves you.

<b><i>If you believe Jesus is God’s son, pause to verbally say that to him out loud.</i></b>

<b>C—Confess your faith in Jesus out loud and to others.</b> Romans 10:9,10 says that “if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Salvation requires your mouth! You must tell both God and others that Jesus is the Lord of your life.

<b><i>If you want Jesus to be the Lord of your life, begin by pausing to ask him verbally right now. Then, pick up the phone and tell someone! Goodness, hop onto Facebook and tell me. I’d so love to know that you prayed this prayer and have become my sister in Jesus today. Welcome to the family!</i></b>

Before we get started, let's review really quickly!

<b>- <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf">Date #1</a> : Your daughter’s primary purpose is to glorify God. (I Corinthians 6:20)
</b><b>- Date #2 : Your daughter’s primary practice, then, must be to look like him and we do that best in the context of distinctive maleness or femaleness. (Genesis 1:26,27)
</b><b>- Date #3 - Your daughter’s body, therefore, must be living sacrifices to God. (Romans 12:1,2)</b>

Ultimately, God gets to choose how we live out the practice of glorifying him and being faithful to glorify God in our bodies as girls and women requires sacrifice. This is a truth that you need to infuse this truth in to your daughter at a young age. It is God who gets to decide how we work, live, give, spend, marry, and worship. Not ourselves. Because what your daughter does now will affect her future, teach her now that sacrifice is critical and she’ll live it out as you and I have learned to do.

Everyone’s career requires sacrifice. Perhaps none more than that of a mom! But your girl probably sees that everyday, so let’s get her into the shoes of someone with a different career that would interest her.

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>Career Day

<i>Subject:</i> Your body should be a living sacrifice

<i>Setting Options</i>: The office of someone whose career interests your daughter (A vet’s office, a horse barn, a church children’s department, a fireman’s truck, an athlete’s gym, etc.)

<i>Materials You’ll Need at Your Destination: </i>

•An appointment with a person whose career would be of interest to your daughter
•A notepad with questions written in it (see below)
•<a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It's Great to Be a Girl</em></a> book by Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel.

There are two goals during the challenge. The first, is to introduce your daughter to an exciting career that may interest her in the future. The second (but more important) purpose is to introduce her to the act of sacrificing her body in obedience to God’s calling on her life.

Schedule an appointment for her to interview someone whose career would be of interest to her. After she’s had a nice tour of the work area, helped to sell a car, saddle a horse, or paint a wall—let her sit down to interview the person she’s shadowing. You will have already written these questions into a notebook so she can ask them and take notes.
<ol>
	<li>1. What is your favorite thing about your career?</li>
	<li>2. What is the least favorite thing about your career?</li>
	<li>3. How do you prepare or care for your body for this field of work?</li>
	<li>4. What sacrifices have you needed to make in the past for this career?</li>
	<li>5. What sacrifices do you continue to make for this career?</li>
</ol>
For the best results use <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body">It’s Great To Be A Girl</a>.</i> Do Meditation #8 together.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Discuss the interview focusing on the way the person sacrificed in the past and even now. (Answers will vary, but in my own career/ministry calling sacrifices include deadlines that force me to work on weekends or holidays, getting up as early as 3:00am to catch flights to speak somewhere, and being willing to go away from home for long periods of time to fulfill God’s call. I have to take care of my body by exercising or using a computer strains my neck. I also have to eat right or I don’t have the energy I need to make the sacrifices of getting up early and travelling. Taking care of my body is part of the sacrifice because I don’t like to exercise and control my eating but I know that I must to be healthy.)</li>
	<li>2. Read Romans 12:1,2. What does it mean to be a “living sacrifice?” (Answer: It means to give things up like sleep, free time, or hobbies so you can be disciplined and obedient.)</li>
	<li>3. How can you—as a tween girl—practice being a “living sacrifice” today so that you can be obedient to God in the career he calls you to? (Answers will vary but may include: helping you wash the dishes when you ask me, keeping my room clean so I can find things, finishing my homework before I watch TV, and getting up early enough to take care of my body—brushing my teeth, brushing my hair, taking a bath if I need it— before school.)</li>
	<li>4. MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION: Do you know what my career is? (Answer may be “mom” or  she may answer referring to a career you have outside the home. Either way, take this time to tell her that your career as a wife and mom is the most important thing that you do. That you love it more than any other career you’ve ever had and you’d happily be “wife” and “mom” at the expense of all the other careers in the world. Explain to her sacrifices you have made for this. Infuse her with passion for the greatest career in the world: mom.)</li>

In <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf">Devo #1</a>, you learned that the purpose of your body, of your daughter's body is to glorify God.

The next conversation to have with your daughter sits solidly on the truth that her primary purpose is to glorify God. Since that means she must make him known and visible, her primary practice will be to look like Him. Have fun on this 'Girls Night Out'!

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>Girl’s Night Out

<i>Key Verse: </i>Genesis 1:27

<i>Key Thought: </i>God made girls to reflect his image.

<i>Suggested Challenge Setting: </i>A fun place to eat out like a tea house or sports club. Use your daughter’s personality to pick the kind of place where you’ll host your girl’s night out.

<i>Recommendation:</i> Do this with a group of women. Ideally, women and their daughters who are using this book. Since each woman will be different in her expression of femininity, your daughter will be able to avoid getting stuck in stereotypes while still embracing her role as a woman.

<i>Materials You’ll Need at Your Destination</i>:

• Each adult or young adult woman attending should bring a photo (pulled from a magazine or taken by herself) that represents what it means to be a woman and why she loves it. (Ideas: This can be a picture of a tom boy playing softball and the woman who shares it can say that she loves being a woman who gets to play sports. Or it can be a picture of a woman with a baby and the woman who shares it can say she loves that women get to give birth and care for babies. You get the idea. Let it reflect the woman. The photos will be as diverse as your guest list.)

• <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It's Great to Be a Girl</em></a> book by Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel.

Select your destination, and invite your guests. Make sure you tell them to bring a photo that is reflective of their style of womanhood.

Once you are at the restaurant, you have one specific task, and it’s very easy: each woman will share her thoughts on womanhood by presenting the pre-selected photo to your daughter (or to the entire group if you are doing it as a small group). (More ideas: This can be a picture of a little girl playing dress up and the woman who shares it can say that she still loves it when she gets to dress up and express her beauty. Or it can be a picture of a woman working and the woman who shares it can say how she loves that God invites women to work hard.) Each photo can be presented to your daughter after it is explained.

You’ll wrap up this sharing time by presenting your own photo and the conversational teaching in this chapter.

Have your conversation at dinner after the meal is cleaned up or during dessert as a group. If you are using <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><i>It’s Great To Be A Girl</i></a>, do Meditation #2 together or assign it as homework.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Read Genesis 1:27 and talk about the word God uses to describe maleness and femaleness. (Answer: image or statue.) What does it mean that we are the image or statue of God? (Answer: Because he wants others to see him and so we must look like him in some way.)</li>
	<li>2. List some ways that boys and girls are very different. (Answer: Body parts, physical strength, interests, etc.) Review why God would have us be so very different, but still be capable of using us to look like him? (Answer: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are distinctively different and yet unified in to one. Since man and woman are different, but can become united in marriage we are a picture of God.)</li>
	<li>3. Read Ephesians 5:31,32. Talk about how maleness and femaleness comes together to be one. (Answer: Marriage.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Budget Cruncher: </b><i>A Girl’s Night Out at someone’s home can be a less expensive way to facilitate this conversation and every bit as fun. Each woman can bring one dish to share. You and your daughter should either make your food together before you go or make separate dishes. Let her be a part of the food fun! Here are some themes that could make food prep really fun as well as a few recipes. </i>

<strong>Lemon Moon Cookies</strong>

1 box lemon cake mix

2 cups Cool Whip topping

1 egg, beaten

2 T. lemon juice

Mix all of the above ingredients together. The mixture will be like a sticky pizza dough though not stretchy. Take a teaspoon full of batter and drop it into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Then, put the sugar dipped drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 11 minutes. Let cool before letting them melt in your mouth!

Have you noticed it? One minute she's as happy as a lark, and in a matter of seconds she can become enraged with anger or defeated in tears with no explanation at all. Nothing welcomes a tween to puberty quite like <em>mood swings</em>. Before you get frustrated, remember what it was like, Mom. You were there once too.

Hormones. They can make girls feel as though they are riding an emotional roller coaster through puberty. (Others living with a moody tween might find themselves clinging to the roller coaster for dear life!) Your daughter will either learn to control her emotions and feelings, or she will become controlled by them.

In addition to praying for extra grace and patience with your daughter, here are some tips for communicating with and encouraging your moody girl:

<strong>1. You have a choice</strong>. Remind your daughter God not only equipped her body with hormones, he equipped her spirit with self-control. God-given and more powerful than any hormone, self-control is a choice she must make. (Galatians 5:22-23a) Place the ball in her court and remind her that she can choose to respond to her emotions by exercising God's gift of self-control.

<strong>2. Take a moment.</strong> Encourage her to live by truth - she knows God desires us to be loving, respectful and kind to one another. When the mood swing sweeps her off her feet, have her take a moment before she reacts/responds to the situation that has pushed her button. Maybe it's a few deep breaths and counting to ten, going for walk or run, calmly going to her room to cool off and even have a good cry. Honor her need for space and privacy and encourage her to take it if and when she needs space. Mom, use this time to hit your knees in prayer for your girl. Fight for her and ask God for a special does of wisdom, discernment and patience.

<strong>3. Process and pray. </strong>No one can handle her emotions like God can. Rather than exploding on a parent, sibling or friend, have your daughter express her frustrations to God. Whether she's angry, sad, lonely, frustrated, defeated or just plain grumpy, help her find ways to communicate her emotions to the Lord. Maybe it's journaling, listening to worship music, drawing, or going on a hike and speaking out loud to him. He is big enough - he can handle her moods without taking offense.

<strong>4.</strong> <strong>Right the wrong. </strong>When a mood swing strikes, typically girls respond with hurtful words. Proverbs 12:18 says "The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing." If in her moodiness she has lashed out, show her how to make right the pain she may have caused another; support her as she exercises humility and takes responsibility for her actions.

<strong>5.</strong> <strong>Focus on others</strong>. In the midst of a mood swing, our focus is usually on ourself; how we feel, how we were wronged, how we think things should be… There's no better way to dispel a mood swing than by focusing on someone else. Establish a project she can return to when she's feeling a little hot-headed. Maybe she would enjoy crafting fleece blankets for the local animal shelter, writing notes of encouragement to the community police officers &amp; firemen, baking goodies for the nurses at the hospital or making photo collages for friends. By choosing to focus on others, she takes quick control of her heart, mind and emotions and operates with Jesus' servant heart.

<strong>6.</strong> <strong>You need to respect her.</strong> Yes, mom. Respect her. She doesn't understand her mood swings any more than you do at the moment. If you desire your tween to act respectfully toward you, you need to extend the same respect to her. Don't fly off the handle or resort to yelling (or participating in the tantrum with her). Your girl's body is changing and her brain is undergoing serious re-wiring; either of which can make her extremely volatile at times. By no means should you tolerate her tantrum; give her time to pull herself together before you discuss the situation. Ask if she wants you to stay or be alone while she calms down. When she's ready to talk, listen - listen deeply to what she has to say. Even if you disagree with her position, beliefs or current struggle, seek to find a happy middle. Acknowledge your girl's perspective. Hug her - hold her if she'll let you - and express to her how much she is loved. Pray with her about the situation that has upset her and ask that God teach her how to exercise self-control. Let her know that you've been in her shoes before. Remember what it was like for you… draw that grace from your toes if you need to!

Parenting through the tween years can make you feel like you're the one swinging off your rocker! Avoid the temptation to steer clear of your moody tween. This is when she needs your love, affirmation and acceptance the most.

Most little girls become interested in makeup after witnessing her mother put it on many times. It’s normal for girls to want to be and look like their mommies. If you’ve ever wondered why your daughter wants to help you as you clean the house, cook, or fold laundry - here’s your answer: she wants to emulate you! She looks up to you and admires you. She wants to be like you.

Usually her desire to wear makeup is no different. But as your daughter gets older, her reasons for wanting to dabble in makeup will probably expand as she encounters other girls her age. Unfortunately, there is no ‘correct’ age at which your daughter should start wearing makeup. For instance, Dannah began wearing light foundation in seventh grade but I (Charmaine) didn’t start wearing makeup until I was in college. Every girl and every face is different.

We think that instead of asking ‘when can I start wearing makeup?’ the question should be ‘what is your motivation’ for wearing makeup? In <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It’s Great To Be A Girl</em></a>, authors Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel outline three reasons why your daughter may want to wear makeup and what they think of them. We encourage you to go over this part with your daughters.

<strong>Wearing Makeup to Cover-up
</strong> “Lots of people wear makeup to cover up scars, acne, or birthmarks.” This is the whole reason why concealer or coverup exists, but its important to not overuse those products. If you do, not only can this have you looking like a clown, it could also clog your pores which could lead to more zits. Dannah and Suzy remind us that “the Bible says everything should be done in moderation and that can certainly apply to makeup!”

<strong>Wearing Makeup for Beauty
</strong> ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’ We’ve all heard that famous saying and we think it definitely applies here. “Everyone has her own definition of what is pleasing to look at. There is no true false standard when it comes to beauty. So does makeup make a girl look more beautiful? That would depend on those who are looking at the girl.” Besides, most people tend to think that too much makeup takes away from a person’s natural beauty.

<strong>Wearing Makeup to Look Older
</strong> A lot of times, girls start wearing makeup at young ages because they want to look more mature. You know what, that’s kind of just like telling a lie, right? We think so because “lies are anything we say or fail to say - anything we do or fail to do - that causes others to have an impression that is not true.” When you wear makeup to make yourself look like something that you’re not, you’re lying. Girls, we encourage you to enjoy being you, looking like you, and being young. It’s a beautiful and fun time of life!

Mom, when you see that your daughter’s motivation to wear makeup is pure, not for beauty or not to look older, take notice. When you see that your girl understands that her inner beauty is more important than her outer beauty so she isn't afraid to leave the house with an uncovered blemish, she just might be ready for you to take her to the nearest Sephora or Ulta for some fun! But ultimately, the answer of when should my daughter start wearing makeup is answered by “when Mom and Dad say it’s okay” - plain and simple.

<em>Mother/Daughter Challenge: spend more time beautifying your soul than you do beautifying your face. Example - if you spend 5 minutes in the mirror getting ready (with or without makeup), spend at least 6 minutes with Jesus that day. Simple as that! Try it for a week and notice where the greatest change takes place - your face or your heart. </em>

Looks are exorbitantly important in our world today. Our society is obsessed! Too often, it’s not the soul, heart, or character of a person that determines who or what they are. “Everything is about how [people] look and who is beautiful,” which is ironic because most of the beauty we see on television, billboards and in movies has been vastly altered through the power of makeup and magic of Photoshop. It’s fake. Unattainable. Yet it often tempts a lot of us to be unhappy with our natural and God-given beauty. Why is that?

In Dannah Gresh’s latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Body-Confident-Daughters-Conversations-Tween/dp/0736960058"><i>Raising Body-Confident Daughters</i></a>, she explains that “body consciousness is the state of being constantly aware of the body - either others or your own, but mostly your own.” A simple look at your daughter’s actions and priorities can tell you if she is currently body conscious or at risk of becoming so.

Does she have an obsession with clothing and make-up?
Is she constantly noticing the appearance of others or herself?
Does she seem to have body shame?
Does she sexualize herself or others?
Can she walk past a mirror without checking herself out?

If you daughter suffers from body-consciousness, she will most likely fall prey to being unsatisfied with how her Creator made her and try to achieve beauty in unrealistic and sometimes dangerous ways. If your daughter is body-conscious, she has a greater chance of having low self esteem, depression, and making an early sexual debut. Body-<b>confidence</b> is what we want to help your daughter (and you) achieve!

“Body-confidence is the state of knowing your body’s purpose and being able to depend on it to do what God designed it to do without making too much or too little of it.” On a pendulum, it is located somewhere in the middle of caring enough but not too much. How can this delicate balance be achieved? This may surprise you, but teaching your daughter to confidently care about her body in a godly way doesn’t even start with a focus on her body! It starts with an  “[emphasis on] the care of her spirit and [teaching] her to press in to godliness.” The road to body confidence starts with being more concerned with the spirit than the body.

The body is good. Beautiful. Each one is unique and was skillfully created to display the glory of God! But unless the spirit is surrendered to the control of the Holy Spirit, the body will not accomplish its glorious purpose. God, as your daughter’s Master Designer, is the best voice she can listen to on how to care about her body and appearance in a balanced and honorable way.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Job Qualifications</span></strong>
SKG interns are an important part of our team, therefore they need to have the ability to work and communicate well with other people.

Body image is something nearly every woman on the face of God's beautiful earth has struggled with at one time or another. Can't you relate, Mom?

When I take an honest look and give myself an honest listen, I am confronted with my own ability to harm my daughters. They are listening to you and I.

Our daughters listen when we look in the mirror and complain about our hair and wrinkles. They listen when we say we are fat and ugly. They hear us put ourselves down. They hear us compare our bodies and wardrobes to that of <em>Brittany's</em> mom.

Studies have been done to confirm that what a mom says about her own body becomes a consuming thought in her daughter's mind about <em>her own</em> body. The result? One magazine reported that 30% of ten-year-olds are worried about their body image.

Before you can talk to your daughter about having a healthy body image, you must have one! As women we have been made in the image of God. Perfectly Crafted. Wonderfully Made. Dearly Loved.  Mom, we have to be her role model. We must believe what God says about our beauty - we must speak about our own beauty in a positive light  because our girls are listening!

Once you are living in the freedom of God's beautiful creation (your body!) you are equipped to talk with your daughter about having a healthy body image. Dive in to scripture together: 1 Samuel 16:7, Psalm 139, Proverbs 31:30, Ephesians 2:10, 1 Peter 3:3-4. These verses share God's truth about image and appearance. Challenge each other to memorize these powerful Bible verses!

Let me remind you once more - you are her role model! She is watching what you eat, your exercise regimen, skin care routine and demeanor during "that time of the month." Self esteem rises and body image issues decrease as a result of feeling confident and comfortable with one's body. Living a healthy, active lifestyle can aid in this!

You can even create a series of "dates" to help reinforce the truth about body image. My girls and I wake up to green tea and kickboxing with Jillian Michaels! Start <a href="http://motherdaughterfitness.com/faq-exercise-program-to-help-child-lose-weight-and-build-self-esteem/">exercising</a> together, make healthy <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/creamsicle_breakfast_smoothie.html">smoothies</a>, calculate your <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/">BMI</a> and challenge one another to positive exercise and diet changes, have a <a href="http://www.tommynelson.com/2013/05/celebrate-motherhood-with-a-motherdaughter-spa-date/">spa day</a> where you teach her how to properly care for her hair, nails and skin.

Continue to verbally affirm her natural beauty. She's listening, remember? And, if you're anything like me, you could use the affirmation once in a while too.'

I can still see her perched on the shag carpet stairwell to our basement as she watched over giggling girls. Never can I remember falling asleep without my mother's watchful presence perched right where she belonged. Of course, I never knew she was supervising. I just thought she was having fun with us. She giggled more than any of the rest of us.

In recent years, slumber parties have come under the scrutiny of discerning moms. And for good reason: many times these parties are <em>not</em> well supervised, leaving the girls vulnerable to unfiltered Internet access and Netflix selections that you hope your daughter will never watch! (I write about this in more detail in my book <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/parents/products/six-ways-to-keep-the-little-in-your-girl">Six Ways to Keep the Little in Your Girl</a></i>.)

&nbsp;

Christian bloggers Tim Challies and Faith Tibbets McDonald saw first-hand the increasingly controversial nature of sleepovers in their summer blogs, <a href="http://www.challies.com/articles/6-reflections-on-sleepovers">6 Reflections on Sleepovers</a> and <a href="http://www.todayschristianwoman.com/articles/2000/july/losingsleepoversleepovers.html">Losing Sleep Over Sleepovers</a>?.  Both asked the same question, and both received a tremendous conglomeration of responses.  Should I allow my tweenager to sleep over?  Is it safe?  Frankly, it seemed that some had responses that were rather black and white. I'm not sure that's fair. Our communities are different. Our own personal stamina as moms is different. And, most importantly, our children are different. (Keeping my very verbal and extroverted Lexi Gresh from sleepovers when she was ten would have been like asking her not to breath!) I think there is more than one answer to the sleepover question!

&nbsp;

There are three reasonable responses.

1.) One is to have a “no sleepover” policy. I’ve had friends adopt this, and their daughters survive quite well despite what everyone around them says. My dear friend Kim adopted this for her girls, much to Lexi's lament since she adored her daughter. One reason for the decision was her daughters' commitment to ballet. The rigorous schedule of their lives didn't permit for sleepover hangovers the next day! It was the right decision for her and her daughters.

2.) The second is to let your daughter go to sleepovers only at homes where you know the family well and have confidence that what the girls will be doing is safe and morally appropriate. This policy is something I suggest you ease into when your daughter is 10, 11, or 12. Bob and I adopted this one and felt comfortable with our choice. Our daughters were always and only allowed to stay where we felt they were safe and the parents shared our moral values. It was never uncomfortable for me to tell the moms that I had to approve any movies that were shown. (And, I always made it clear that I'd pick my daughter up if everyone else was allowed to see a movie that she was not. Guess what? I did that once! Lexi lives to tell about it.)

3.) But I think the best option is to be the host home. (Like my mom! Frankly, I don't recall sleeping over at other houses at all. Maybe one. And then, I always wished I was at home.)

<i>“For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so he can do the good things he planned for us long ago.” (Ephesians 2:10)</i>

When my Lexi was nine, she went on her first missions trip to Zambia. God opened her eyes there to real need. Not, "But mom I need it" when she was hungry for a candy bar at the grocery store, but "Oh, mom! They don't have any food" in an orphanage where babies were crying from hunger.

When she returned, she recruited an entire neighborhood full of girls and started a fund raising project. She and her friends would sew bananas for dogs and sell them at the local craft festival. My office was home to a gaggle of girls for weeks who left sewing threads and fabric scraps that surely must be embedded in the carpet to this day. They raised hundreds of dollars and sent the money to Africa to help.

My baby did something "good."

Robert Coles, a pioneer in the field of moral intelligence, brings clarity to the definitions of <i>goodness</i> and <i>badness</i> when he writes:
<p style="text-align: center;">  <i>“good…[children]…have learned to take seriously the very notion, the desireability of goodness—living up to the Golden rule.”<a title="" href="#_edn1"><b>[i]</b></a> Whereas bad [children] display a “heightened destructive self-absorption, in all its melancholy stages.” In essence, we go bad when “we lose sight of our obligation to others.”<a title="" href="#_edn2"><b>[ii]</b></a></i></p>
Goodness is the quality that makes us put others ahead of ourselves. It’s the moral compass that keeps the world safe, happy, and working. It’s the drive that makes us want to function in families rather than isolation. It’s the internal road sign that takes us away from our own desires and toward the destiny of meeting the needs of others. Without it, we are “bad.” That’s probably why all of us–male and female—are called to goodness.
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">God <i>is</i> good.</b></p>
The ultimate reason we must raise our children to be good is that it reflects the character of God. God’s goodness is a bedrock truth of Scripture and an inseparable part of his character. If we are to be a picture of Him, we must possess goodness. He is good not only in a general sense, but he is good TO us and FOR us. This element of his character expresses his selflessness and desire to exist on behalf of others. When people are good they act TOWARD and FOR others, as opposed to losing sight of others as their own needs and desires consume them.

Of course, our children embrace being "good", if they see it in us. I'm constantly having to beat my to-do list in to submission so that I can have the flexibility to meet the needs of others. It's not easy in our culture to have space in our lives to care for each other, but we must.

Let's pray today that God would grow goodness in our children. And let us be willing to be an example of it!

<b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Ephesians 2:10:</b>

<em>Lord, you created my children. It is not difficult for me to see that (insert their names) are masterpieces crafted by you. Would you please help them to see it and understand it and know that the purpose of their greatness is to be good. Before they were created, you planned good things for them to do. Help me to guide them to those opportunities. Teach them to be outside of their own needs and get into the needs of others. Let it begin with my example. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“She is clothed with strength and dignity and laughs without fear of the future.” (Proverbs 31:25)</i></p>
Today I am putting one of my children on an airplane and I won't see her for six months. (Gulp.) Autumn is headed to Taiwan for a discipleship training and missions program, and my mother's heart goes with her but my eyes and my mind and my hands are staying behind. And I feel rather helpless.

It is not the first time I have released one into the world. The first time was when Robby went to kindergarten. (I cried then, too.)

I'm fairly convinced that there is an invisible maternal doppler radar system on the top of a mother's head. The detection wand circles our heads with a certainty that each child is where he or she should be according to the schedule we've reviewed over and over again...until the doppler system has nothing to go on and cannot find said children. Then, the detection circle beeps hazardously warning our spirit that no report on that child's EXACT whereabouts can be provided. I don't know about you, but it is then that I feel helpless. (Read: out of control.)

And, frankly, fellow mother...sometimes I act like it. My responses are not full of God's strength. (If they were, I would not have stress attacks, dump all my fears via texts on my husband, and be verbally severe in my conversation with Autumn as we go over her packing list.) Hmmmm...I've got so much growing up to do!

I started this devotion with the intention to help you pray over your child's future. (And we will.) With Autumn departing, my heart is focused like a laser beam on how these next six months will shape her future—much like yours might be as you send one off to kindergarten, get another started in the AWANA program, or decide whether to put one on the traveling soccer team. Each decision we make for our children now, hints at what they will become and gives us pause to pray.

We must be mothers who pray about our children's future. But in my spirit I'm being led to caution you that it is <em>our attitude about their future, not just their future</em> that God wants us to pray over today.

Our children are going to grow up. Step by step. Day by day. Year by year. With each passing phase, they will be less and less traceable as they march into the future. (I know that there are days where a bubble bath is much in order because they are far TOO traceable...as in always under your feet...but with the beginning of the school year we can ponder those releasings, too.) And we are called to a certain response in the letting go... Proverbs 31:25.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proverbs-31-25.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4899 aligncenter" alt="Proverbs 31-25" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proverbs-31-25-300x251.png" width="300" height="251" /></a>

&nbsp;

Laughing.

There should be more of it in my house at these crucial "letting go" times. If I'm truly clothed in his strength and dignity, stress will not spit out of my mouth nearly as quickly as laughter will roll out of it. When I walk my children to the bus in the morning...time to laugh and play not just rush. When I drive them home from piano...time to giggle about the songs their learning not just establish their practice schedule. When I send them off to high school...time to laugh about new friends not just warn them about bad ones. When I drive Autumn to the airport at 5:30 am this morning, time to laugh about the future...not just stress over it by running through instructions for getting through Chicago O'Hare ONE MORE TIME!

How about you, mom? Does the amount of laughter over life changes, schedules, decisions, and the letting go reflect that your heart is fueled by God's strength and you are clothed in dignity? Let's laugh at the future a little today, shall we?

After all, when we're in over our head it is still under his feet!
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Proverbs 31:25:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lord, I want to confess to you that I am often reactive and express more stress than strength. If I truly believe that you are in control of my children's future, my life will display that I'm clothed in your strength and dignity. I give the future of (insert names of your children) to you. I ask you to help me put on the garment of your strength and the beauty of dignity. Fill my home with laughter, not just when times are easy but when I'm considering the future and can become prone to worry. Help me to remember that anything over my head is still under your feet. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</em></p>

<i>“Then God said, “let us make man in our image, in our likeness…So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26,27)</i>

The other day I was playing with my Facebook account and was shocked to discover fifty-six gender options. They include “transgender,” (for those who feel their gender is different than their sex organs would suggest) “gender fluid,” (in case you like to go both ways) “male to female/mtf” (meaning a sex change is in the making), and you can add a suggestion if you can’t find one of the fifty-six that fit your preference. Please don’t write to Facebook and complain. My point is not for us to boycott anyone, but to raise an awareness in you that your child is growing up in a world that does not embrace the roles of male and female. And there will be a lot of pressure for him or her to embrace tolerance for all gender preferences. Unless, of course, your preference is to stick with God created: male and female. This must be bathed in prayer, mom.

Take another look at Genesis  1:26,27 again.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“Then God said, “let us make man in our image, in our likeness…So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” </i></p>

There are so many God-like qualities that humanity possesses. Why doesn’t God mention the traits of being intelligent or worshipful or creative when he says we were created in his image? Why doesn’t he commend our language proficiency or our ability to compose sonnets? Apparently these are not the things that make us most like a representation of God. It is our maleness and our femaleness that makes us like  Him. This places authentic humanity and sexuality in the context of male and female distinctiveness. Our ability to look like him mandates that we embrace those differences, not erase them.

The book of Romans teaches us much concerning this issue. Disregarding God's definitions for manhood and womanhood is a rebellious refusal to glorify him and an attempt to hide who he is and <i>whose</i> we are.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/“Disregarding-Gods-definitions-for.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4897 aligncenter" alt="“Disregarding God's definitions for" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/“Disregarding-Gods-definitions-for-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/genitalia-are-not-destiny-but-are-they-design">Pastor John Piper puts it this way</a>:
<blockquote><i>God’s divine nature is revealed in the physical, material universe. So much so that verse 20 says, “So they are without excuse” when they “exchange the glory of God for the glory of the creature” (verse 23), or when they “exchange the truth about God for a lie and worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator.” (verse 25).</i>

<i>Paul is saying that the material, physical universe reveals God’s true nature, and his design for humans to worship him.</i>

<i>Then Paul draws the parallel with human sexuality. Just as physical nature reveals the truth about God, so physical nature reveals truth about sexual identity. <em>Whom</em> we should worship is not left to our preferences, and <em>who we are</em> sexually is not left to our preferences. Both are dictated by God’s revelation in nature.</i>

<i>The parallel Paul is making is this: On the one hand, cosmology is designed by God to reveal truth about <em>God’s</em> identity (as powerful and divine); on the other hand, biology (anatomy) is designed by God to reveal truth about <em>our </em>identity (as male and female). This truth is so plain, Paul says, that we are “without excuse” if we don’t see it and agree with it.<a title="" href="#_edn1"><b>
</b></a></i></blockquote>
In Romans, the apostle Paul also begs for us to lay down our own plans for our bodies, and to make them daily, living, breathing sacrifices to our purpose of glorifying God. This includes how we work, live, give, spend and even who we have sex with no matter what gender “preference” might be tempting to us. Those verses read:
<blockquote><i>“I appeal to you therefore...by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12: 1,2)</i></blockquote>
Why did God make you a woman?

Because you were created to contribute to humanity’s purpose of glorifying and enjoying God, and God chose for you to do that as a woman. You illuminate who God is when you embrace the role of womanhood because it is in male and female distinctions that we are the image of God. There will be times when this is a sacrifice for you. And there will be times when it will be a sacrifice for your daughter, as well.

Will you give of yourself (as Christ did), renew your mind, and become a discerning woman of God so that your body may be a beautiful living sacrifice? Will you teach your children to do the same in this challenging world?

<p align="center"><em>By Dannah Gresh, Creator Secret Keeper Girl</em></p>
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Read: Isaiah 54:9-17</b></p>
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"></b><i>“All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.” Isaiah 54:13</i></p>
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">As I read Isaiah 54:9-17 today, the rain was pelting so hard against my window and the thunder clapping so loudly that I don’t have to imagine what worry Noah felt when the doors to the ark closed with a thud and a mere man heard wet and wild fury on the other side! It sounds like that in State College, Pennsylvania today. And I’m worried. I worry for my menagerie of barn animals. Is the barn flooding? Is sweet Kanga, our mini fainting goat who is struggling with a bout of lameness, able to make her way to shelter? Will one of my horses slip in the mud?</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">How storms—especially the emotional and spiritual ones—test our faith and rattle our foundation. Doesn’t matter how big (a child starting the school year with a frightening health diagnosis) or how small (a child having trouble making friends at the beginning of the school year), as moms we can be consumed by the storm at the expense of the peace God means for us to know. Each of my three children is facing mini-storms right now, and I’m worried. One is facing overload and stress like never before. Another is having a hard time finding a solid friend to share life with. And then there’s the one struggling with a life change. I just don’t like storms when they impact my children.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">It is such a storm we find in Isaiah 54.</span>

But look at the promises in the midst of it!

Mom, though the mountains shake and the hills be moved, “you will not be shaken,” Mom. “No weapon formed against you will prosper.”

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NO-WEAPON.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4894 aligncenter" alt="NO WEAPON" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NO-WEAPON-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Do you need that today? I sure do.

Nestled in the midst of all these promises for us, is one for our children: “great will be their peace.” I want this for my precious Rob (and his new fiance Aleigha), Lexi, and Autumn. Oh, how I want it! Do you want it for your children? So let’s figure out <i>how</i> it comes to them so we can be sure we cooperate in God's plan to bring it to them. Peace comes with a caveat. The whole verse reads, “Your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.”

A teacher cannot teach a student unless he or she places themselves in the presence of the teacher. Your child cannot be taught by the Lord unless he or she is still and sits under the instruction of the Holy Spirit. If we want our children to have peace in the midst of their storms, it will be found in the sitting.

And that comes for you and I, too. Let us not forget, we are Someone’s child. We are His child. He wants your peace to be great no matter what storm is around you. And that peace does not come from cleaning your house, crossing off your to-do list, managing your children’s schedules, or making <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/dannahgresh/meal-time/">Pinterest</a> worthy meals. (I don’t know about you but my Pinterest recipes never look like the picture, anyway!) The peace you are looking for doesn’t come from the doing. It comes from the sitting.

Sit at His feet if you are in need of peace. As His Spirit instructs your heart, it will be overwhelmed with peace. Mine was today.

And our children cannot learn this if we do not model it, my friend!
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Isaiah 54: 9-17</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lord, there are storms in our lives right now. They include (list them one by one). I feel the shaking of the mountains and the moving of the hills and I need to cling to your promise that neither I nor my children will be shaken. Help me to sit at your feet to be instructed no matter what my house looks like, no matter how big my to-do list may be, and no matter what the needs of my children are. I believe that if I put you first, you will teach me and that will bring peace.

Well, one thing is for sure our days and lives are CRAZY when we're on tour. Here's a taste of what it looks like behind the scenes including a look at the world's largest hamburger (a necessary tour survival tool at midnight) and the staggering gas bill that brings us to you each season.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Backstage.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4759 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Backstage-200x300.jpg" alt="Backstage" width="200" height="300" /></a>

<strong>FACT #1: Our brain is called MasterTour.</strong> Coordinating up to 50 tour stops in three months with a tour team of up to 12 and an off-road management team of only 4 takes a brain. And we have one. It's called MasterTour. Each team member has this app on our smart phone it tells us everything from when we get to sleep to what city we will be in tomorrow to who we will meet when we get there. Here's what our map looks like at the beginning of a season.

PIC
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Our tour map for Fall 2015<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FACT #2: Our bed is a bus.</strong> God blessed us last year with the ability to upgrade from van transportation/hotels to a tour bus that we sleep on while we drive. (Well only one of us drives and he doesn't sleep.) Shout out to NewSong who previously owned the bus and used it for WinterJam, the world's largest concert tour! We wake up each morning to the same view: the back side of a church parking lot (and maybe a team member like Haley having her morning beverage whilst sitting on the front dash. The glasses are mandatory since we don't get the chance to wash up before we're in the church. We don't want to scare anyone now, do we?)</p>
<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4771 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="photo" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year we travelled 37,223 miles in our tour bus and used $38,459 worth of gas. (That's a lot of gas!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #3: We blow up a lot of balloons each morning.</strong> Each event requires stage set up that takes us about 3 hours. No one gets the morning off. We all help set up lighting, sound equipment, staging pipe and drape, the resource table signs and banners, books, and lots and lots of balloons. The balloon sculptures for the stage take about an hour and require several volunteers from our host church (whom we love so much) managed by one team member such as Lexi who handles our 7' crazy hair column topper with expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4762 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons-300x252.png" alt="Balloons" width="300" height="252" /></a> <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4765 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n-225x300.jpg" alt="155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Last year we spent about 80 hours blowing up 17,760 balloons.</em></p>
<strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #5: We manage a lot of clothes and props backstage.</strong> From the world's largest chicken egg to a complete set of authentic vintage clothing from four different decades, our stage team manages all of its own props. We put them out in the morning and do a careful accounting of each item at the end of each night. Heather (vintage clothing coordinator) and Jordan ("It's Sew Crazy" tween fashion show designer) are seen below organizing one of our wardrobes last season.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4766 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n-300x225.jpg" alt="312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<em>The Crazy Hair Tour uses 111 props each night including the world's largest sling shot! </em>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #6: Every day we do a sound check.</strong> The last thing we do before daily team devos and lunch is our sound check. We're usually excited by this point because it means we're almost to the part of the day that we get "off." From about noon to four we get to hang out in our bus home or get a shower in a local hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4769 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n-225x300.jpg" alt="10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Charmaine...it might look like a sound check, but she's thinking about lunch.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #7: We eat at midnight.</strong> They say that being on stage for one hour is the equivalent of a 4 hour workout. Since we're on stage for nearly three hours, we are starving by the time the bus is loaded up and our pjs (comprised of sweat pants and sweat shirts) are on. We have been known to eat burgers the size of our heads (Lexi) and pizza no less worth talking about (Suzy) at midnight which is when we roll on out of one city and head to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4768 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger-294x300.png" alt="Burger" width="294" height="300" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year our food budget was $11,799. (We eat less than the bus, that's for sure!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After our midnight snack, it's off to bed in our trusty tour bus. And on to the next city to do it all over again!</p>

I don't know about everyone else, but I'm poised to contribute to a conversation that says men are good in an effort to dispel the myths perpetuated by lousy commercials that have been the norm for far too long. Move over myths, there's a #HowToDad movement on the prowl complete with advice on how to treat your wife and what to do when your son attempts to scare the tar out of you before your feet hit the ground.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Myths TV Perpetuates</strong></p>
We have a bad boy—as opposed to a good men— mentality in culture. One reason is that the a cultural movement told us they are bad. Michael Gurian, author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Boys-Michael-Gurian/dp/1585425281">The Wonder Of Boys</a></em>, though seeming to embrace the feminist movement as a whole points out a few devastating myths it introduced to convince our boys that they are “bad.” Here are two that resonate with me:
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Myth Number One:</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“that masculinity is responsible for the world’s ills and femininity is the world’s salvation.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Myth Number Two:</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“males destroy, females create; males stand in the way of positive spiritual/social values; males are inherently violent.”</em></p>
Just consider how prevalently these two myths are portrayed in the media. Television alone reinforces them with programs like Modern Family where the guys are sweet, but stupid. (Even the reruns of The Simpsons portray the contrast between bright and beautiful Lisa and stupid and out-of-shape Bart.) Co-ed television commercials often portray the guy as ditzy and the girl as smart. It’s funny. It really is. But how much of it can we expose ourselves to before we believe it? How much can our sons and husbands be exposed to before they plummet into self-fulfilling prophecy mode?

Today’s men as a whole have pretty much rolled over and taken it. But this viral Cheerio ad gives me hope. Hope that boys can be taught to grow up to be good men
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> Goodness vs. Badness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robert Coles, a pioneer in the field of moral intelligence, brings clarity to the definitions of goodness and badness when he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“</em>good…boys…have learned to take seriously the very notion, the desireability of goodness—living up to the Golden rule.” Whereas bad boys display a “heightened destructive self-absorption, in all its melancholy stages.” In essence, we go bad when “we lose sight of our obligation to others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Goodness is the quality that makes us put others ahead of ourselves. (And this quality is so vibrant and visible in the Cheerio's ad.) Goodness is the moral compass that keeps the world safe, happy, and working. It’s the drive that makes us want to function in families—from waking up with scary horse masks up our nostrils to making coffee for each other— rather than isolation. It’s the internal road sign that takes us away from our own desires and toward the destiny of meeting the needs of others. Without it, we are “bad.” That’s probably why all of us–male and female—are called to goodness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with goodness.”
Romans 12:21</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The New Testament Greek word for “goodness”—used here and in other places— appears in three forms, all of which are rooted in the Hebrew word “tob”, which meant “usefulness.” Are we bringing up boys who understand their call of duty to be useful contributors to society? One important component of helping boys understand their duty, is portraying it in the mediums of our culture. That's why I think the Cheerio's ad is an epic victory for those of us who believe that men are good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. Someone go buy some Peanut Butter Cheerios and send a message that we like this message. A lot.</p>

Unlit. Unretouched. Un-size-0! Robyn Lawley is proof that a size 12 is not a plus size. (The modeling industry categorizes anyone over a size 6 as plus.)

While not every teen or tween girl should see these photos, many should. It might make them think differently about their own body.

A picture is worth a thousand words.

Here are some conversation starters if you decide to take time to look at Lawley's <a href="http://www.myfoxchicago.com/story/26102615/australian-model-posts-untouched-bikini-photo">unretouched (and often immodest) photo library</a>.
<blockquote>•This model tried to get smaller, but couldn't. Based on the photos, do you think she needed to be smaller?

•You begin to believe anything you dwell on. Knowing this and seeing the truth in these photos, do you think it's a good idea to feast on fashion magazines?

•If the modeling industry is not representing all sizes, but represent anorexic (eating disorder) sizes what does this say about who they represent? Should we want to look anorexic?

•Since we can't get a true picture of beauty (literally) from the modeling world, where should we look?</blockquote>

<em>We posted it as a question for moms to discuss and it got a little "opinionated." One mom even defended the fact that her daughter just thinks it is fun and punctuated it by posting an adorable photo of her and her girl giving us "duck face!" I, Dannah, asked Secret Keeper Girl lead teacher Charmaine Porter to weigh in. And...here she is with a really silly "duck face"!</em>

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-1-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4735 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-1-3-225x300.jpg" alt="photo 1 (3)" width="225" height="300" /></a>

The photography phenomenon, known as “duck face” seems to have taken the social media world by storm recently. It started on television, in fashion magazines, celebrities picked up the trend. And NOW it’s trickled down to your little girl! Is it OK?

Because of the world we live in, our children tend to associate beauty with what they see on Facebook, Instagram, and on TV and movies. Since celebrities and models do the duck face, the thinking in a tween girl might be like this: "The world has deemed this celebrity/model as beautiful… she is making the duck face… maybe I need to do that to be beautiful as well."

It’s normal and natural that your daughter wants to be and feel beautiful and there’s nothing wrong with that. After all, moms, don’t you want to feel and be beautiful as well? But, as we say on the Secret Keeper Girl tour, Christians are supposed to go a bit beyond what’s normal and right into unique and crazy for Jesus! Let's analyze "duck face" in this light.

1.) <em><strong>Your daughter may have pure and simply silly intentions when she makes "duck face." </strong></em>After seeing a comment posted by a mom and totally agreeing with her, I feel this should where we begin. The main issue with “duck face” is not the act itself but the motivation and heart behind it. So as you communicate and discuss this with your child, if “duck face” is just a fun, silly thing she likes to do, then by all means, LET HER PLAY! And, as one mom suggested, play with her and be a part of those silly photos. She’s a child with a fun personality and that shouldn’t be quenched.

2.) <em><strong>If your daughter's intentions don't seem pure and silly, dig a little deeper in conversation to see what they might be.</strong> </em>Ask her WHY she is posing that way. Why is she contouring her face ? Ask her WHO she saw posing like that if that person is someone she truly desires to model or emulate. Many of the models and celebs who pose like this do have trashy sensual intentions. I'm not the only one who thinks this either: “[Duck face] is meant to be seductive, although why anyone would think ducks are sexy, I don't know.”[1] As an example, here's a carefully cropped photo of one of this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SImodel.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4738" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SImodel-300x195.jpg" alt="SImodel" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
While your daughter may not think sexually about her lips at all, make sure she's not copying sensual behavior and believing it to be "beauty." If this is what's in her head, explain to her the intentions of the models and that copying that kind of behavior is not ok.

3.) <em><strong>Use the conversation as a chance to discuss what God's word says about our beauty.</strong></em> Turn to the Word of God. While we won’t find mention of "duck faces" in the Bible, we do see that even back in Biblical times, people were more concerned with outward than inward beauty. There truly is nothing new under the sun! A great place to start is with this favorite Secret Keeper Girl verse:
<blockquote>"Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or beautiful clothes. You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so precious to God." I Peter 3:3-4 (NLT)</blockquote>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">A good modern day paraphrase might read: "Don't be concerned about outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, beautiful clothes, or carefully posed duck face selfies!" True beauty can’t be captured in a pose or photograph. True beauty and attractiveness is not found in duck lips.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">It comes from the presence of God.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">There is nothing wrong with wanting to be and feel beautiful; it’s one of the most fun things about being a girl! So let’s model and teach your daughter to make sure that her heart is even more beautiful than how she looks on the outside. Talk. Discuss. Ask questions. Let her speak. And above all else, encourage her to spend more time in the mirror of God’s word discovering how “look” truly beautiful (more like Him) and a little less time practicing silly poses in the mirror trying to mimic the latest trend.</p>

<h3>What does the Secret Keeper Girl Event Look  Like?</h3>
Just push play for a peak at some of last year's fun!

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sOPlBUdrh2g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h3>What is Secret Keeper Girl?</h3>
Secret Keeper Girl is a program that is the brainchild of the dynamic <a href="http://purefreedom.org/meet/dannah/">Dannah Gresh</a>. Gresh is an author and speaker who wants girls to know that they are more than what society tells them they are. Out of this idea came the book “Secret Keeper.” This book teaches girls about the necessity of maintaining their modesty and keeping appropriate relationships with boys until they are married. Secret Keeper Girl offers advice and interaction for moms and tween girls. For example, “<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/petition/">The Modesty Project</a>” is a petition started in 2009 to encourage designers to make more modest clothing for girls. And, we have "date” kits for mothers and daughters to have fun while discussing important topics.
<h3>What is the current Crazy Hair Tour Like?</h3>
If you ever wanted an opportunity to really let your hair down, the <em>Crazy Hair Tour</em> is it.

First, you and your daughter can dress as fashionably silly and fun as you want, as long as it is modest. Then, if you are feeling it, you can pick the craziest hairstyle you can imagine.

Once you arrive at the event, you will be swept up in a storm of excitement. The <em>Crazy Hair Tour</em> is a game show and fashion show rolled into one. You can enjoy competing in the games, learning about current fashion, and see how the Bible stays relevant, even in modern times. The point of the show is to help persuade girls to be “God-crazy” instead of boy-crazy. That way, they will get more direction from the Bible, and take less advice from fashion magazines.
<h3>Who wants to go?</h3>
This event is targeted at Tween girls (ages 8-12) and their moms. It is popular for the girls because the show gets you up on your feet and the fun never stops. Moms like it because it spreads a message they feel is hard to get across, as girls get more and more influence from worldly people and agendas. There are <a href="http://purefreedom.org/tour">many stops on the Crazy Hair Tour</a> this fall, in the following states:
<ul>
	<li>Florida</li>
	<li>Tenneessee</li>
	<li>Mississippi</li>
	<li>Iowa</li>
	<li>South Carolina</li>
	<li>North Carolina</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania</li>
	<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

My heart was just bursting with the good work God had done at our recent FREE outreach event with Brooklyn Tab just a few weeks earlier. So, I got on the stage and told the moms and girls of Tennessee about it. About how my team prayed one-on-one until each and every sexually broken mom or girl had been loved on. How we left behind a partner—Brooklyn Tab— with the strength to continue walking with them, but just a little more fueled and armed to do battle for them. How I'd prayed with the most precious little girl to receive Jesus as her Lord and Savior...and the photographer had caught me kissing her on the head.

We LOVE reducing the risk of early sexual debut and brokenness in high risk pockets of community. It is our greatest honor to encourage girls to write a different legacy than their community expects them to write.

I stood up filled with the passion of having just seen God's Spirit rescuing girls...for the fourth time in Brooklyn. And how we've had to say "no" to requests in Detroit, Philadelphia, and even overseas. I told those moms and girls in Tennessee all the details.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4536 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n-300x200.jpg" alt="1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Then they told me something. Those moms and girls of Tennessee told me and my team that they wanted the answer to be "yes" from now on.

How did they tell us?

With dollars. Lots of them. And before we knew it we had funding to do more outreach events. We've already fully funded grant events in the following locations and located event coordinators who are so full of the hope and love of God that they want to pour it out where it's been missing. In the fall we will go to:
<ul>
	<li>Belle Glades, Florida (Ashley Tripp)</li>
	<li>A suburb of Richmond, VA (Truin Huntley - First Things First)</li>
	<li>East Liverpool, OH (Cindy Popejoy)</li>
</ul>
And, while the majority of our funding will stay right here in the United States, we are planning a very important trip for next year to bring sexual wholeness to girls experiencing "survival sex" in Haiti.

Moms and girls at our live events have blessed us so much that we thought we should name this gentle, but strong move of God's Spirit for girls to help girls. So, we have.

Mother/Daughter kitchen dates are some of the best, right Mom?

<strong>Purple Flurp</strong> is featured in one of our <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens">Secret Keeper Girl Fiction Series</a> books, <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens/products/danikas-totally-terrible-toss">Danika’s Totally Terrible Toss</a></i>. Danika takes some of her mom's famous Purple Flurp dessert to school. But, it's not eaten… something goes terribly wrong! (You'll have to read to learn what happened!)

We recently had a mom and daughter write in and ask us if  Purple Flurp is a real recipe. You bet it is!
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Secret Keeper Girl Purple Flurp</b></p>

You’ll need:
<ul>
	<li>1 can of crushed pineapple</li>
	<li>1 can of blueberry pie filling</li>
	<li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
	<li>1 8 oz. tub of Cool Whip</li>
</ul>
Mix the three canned items together and refrigerate them overnight. Add the tub of Cool Whip right before you serve it to all your friends. This Secret Keeper Girl tried it and said, "It's super good!"

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How can I simply make conversation with my daughter? I don’t know what to talk about. </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Sometimes it does seem like girls do speak a different language. Many fathers have been clueless at times too! Have you ever said something to your princess that evokes sudden anger or a waterfall of tears?  You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? What did I say wrong this time?

Even if she tires to shut you out or “doesn’t want to talk to dad about it,” there are tried and true ways to make conversation with your daughter that often opens up the door to her heart.

It’s that inner child thing. Stop and try to remember what it was like to be her age. Consider the things you loved, the things you hated, the things you cared about. It really isn’t probably all that far off.

As men, it really is amazing some of the things we put to memory. You probably know the stats for your favorite sports team. Countless song lyrics. Random facts about technology. Stock numbers… Study your daughter - know her like you know your favorite team; after all she is far more important to you, right?

Think of it this way: <strong><i>you should date your daughter</i></strong>. If you're still stumped, check out <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/8-great-dates-for-dads-and-daughters-understanding-boys"><em>8 Great Dates for Dads and Daughters</em></a> to get started! What questions would you ask on a regular date? Do you know her teacher’s name?  Who in her class has a “boyfriend”? Why she dislikes PE so much?  What’s her favorite song? If you can’t answer all of those questions confidently, you’ve got plenty to talk about! The time that she actually will <i>want</i> to spend talking to you will all-too-quickly come to a close. Don't take that time for granted - start with these:
<ul>
	<li>Who is your best friend? Why? What do you like about him/her?</li>
	<li>What is your biggest goal this year? How can I support you?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite meal?</li>
	<li>What makes you worry?</li>
	<li>If someone gave you $50, how would you spend it?</li>
	<li>What would you like to do when you grow up?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite activity we do together?</li>
	<li>What makes you feel loved?</li>
	<li>What is your dream vacation destination?</li>
	<li>Who do you consider to be your hero and why?</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How Can I Spend Quality Time With My Daughter If I Really Don’t Have That Much Time to Spare? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
The Pew Research Center conducted the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/14/men-women-work-time/1983271/">American Time Use Survey</a> in 2012 and discovered that fathers spend 7 hours with their children per week – much of that time involves technology (meaning you’re parked in front of the tv or computer). Convicting much? We must make time! Simple as that. She needs you! Yes, work and responsibilities are an important and necessary part of life. However, if your daughter feels that work is more important to you than she is, it might be a good time to reevaluate your schedule and priorities. Ask her. I dare you.

Consider when you really do have time to be fully focused on her. Block that time off and plan intentional activities or events and put them on your calendar in advance. It is so easy to become wrapped up in work, busyness and the full-plate that comes with parenthood, that we forget how to slow down, have fun and enjoy life. Put away your laptop, turn off your cell phone, and genuinely be with her. Even if you’re not able to have the quantity of time with your daughter that you’d like, make sure the time you do spend is quality time.

Using the time, energy and resources you do have, rekindle your creativity and get in touch with the child inside you.  Capitalize on her interests. Do what you know <i>she</i> would enjoy. Maybe you should go camping or fishing for a weekend. Have mornings free? Take her out to breakfast once a week before school and work begin. She won’t remember the deadline you had or the make-or-break meeting you were stressing about, but she will remember the intentional times you made her your sole focus and priority. She just needs you. All of you. Your focus, energy and attention. Make the time. When she is 18 and pulling out of your driveway for college you will wish you had more of it.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>How can I build my daughter’s confidence? </i></strong></p>
</blockquote>
While you can and should verbally affirm your daughter on a daily basis, I find that teaching her something seems to boost her confidence level. I believe that the handyman does not always have to be a guy. Spend quality time with her by teaching her: how to fix the toilet when it overflows, car maintenance, setting a mousetrap, finding the water main, repairing the fence, painting the wall – even killing a spider. It can be empowering for her to know that she is strong and capable and that she doesn’t always need a rescuer to do it for her.

Teaching her life skills like budgeting, yard work, and house repairs equip her to be self-sufficient and teach her that she can be independent. Build her up and encourage her as you work on projects together. Let her have a shot at it. We’re already proud of our daughters – but sometimes it’s nice to watch her be proud of herself.'

<em>Hey Secret Keeper Girl Dads!</em>

<em>It's about time we offered some tips to you! We imagine you have just a few questions about your tween daughter, like “Is she really from another planet?” In this blog series, Bob Gresh, author of <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/8-great-dates-for-dads-and-daughters-understanding-boys">8 Great Dates for Dads and Daughters</a> will answer some of the most frequently asked questions we receive from Dads.</em>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Is it OK to be involved in my daughter's dating life when she's older?</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Ummm… YES. It’s not ok for you <i>not </i>to be involved! I firmly believe in interviewing the gentlemen who have taken interest in my girls. Lord knows I’ve put a few young men through the most intensely awkward interview of their life! It was not at all to demonstrate my power as Dad, but to protect my girls and create a system of accountability and expectation for the boy driving them to the movie theater.

I wouldn’t wait until she’s older… I would get involved in her dating life NOW. When she’s 10 it’s much easier to express your desires for her dating relationships as well as family rules and boundaries than when she’s 16.

At some point, you have to tell your kids point-blank what your standards and expectations are. We adopted the dating protocol of the LaHayes after reading their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Sexually-Pure-Kids-Children/dp/1576733920"><i>Raising Sexually Pure Kids</i></a>. We decided to let our kids go on group dates for special events as soon as they hit high school. That means they could go on a chaperoned formal event, if they wanted, at the age of 14 or 15.

Our teenagers were allowed to go on single dates when they were 16, as long as we were actively involved in the planning and execution of the evening. What do I mean by “actively involved”? Well, Lexi and Autumn always knew that a guy who wanted to take them out has to go through an interview with me. Period. If the boy seemed to have honorable intentions and was someone we felt comfortable with, we most likely allowed them to spend a carefully planned, very public evening together. We were approving everything they did, and they were in close contact with us.

Finally, we discouraged our girls from being in any exclusive relationships until they were out of high school. We really wanted them to enjoy their high school years free from the drama relationships tend to bring, and we didn’t want their heart wounded by excessive relationships.

I can’t overestimate the importance of establishing and communicating your family’s dating standards when your daughter is a tween, even if that seems difficult. I also can’t understate how easy it is. My kids’ hearts were so innocent that it was just comfortable and natural to discuss. My girls still thought boys had cooties! It’s easy to establish your standards if you do so before their hormones kick in and “everyone else” has a boyfriend.

The young men who show an interest in your daughter and desire to spend time alone with her need us to hold them accountable for their actions, words and thought life. There is a huge need for more men – older men, dads, youth pastors – to challenge them to protect our daughters, their sisters in Christ, and do what is necessary to guard their heart as well as their purity.

Dennis Rainey, President and CEO of FamilyLife raised four beautiful daughters and wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interviewing-Your-Daughters-Date-Man-To-Man/dp/1602005257"><i>Interviewing Your Daughter’s Date</i></a><i>.</i> It is a great resource to consider when your daughter begins to date.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How do I talk to my daughter about her period? Should I acknowledge it? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Yes, I said "her period." Breathe, man. It’s not rocket science. Your daughter is growing up way too fast before your very eyes and there isn’t a thing you can do to stop it. If you’re anything like me, this can be very difficult to watch… after all, she is our <i>little </i>girl.

Nearly forty percent of girls starting their period have never heard about it from their parents. It’s not uncommon for girls to approach this phase of puberty and suddenly feel uncomfortable around Dad. She might not want you to hug her or love on her the same way you’ve always done. She may suddenly become embarrassed or stand-offish. Girls are often confused by their body changes and are embarrassed to talk about it… especially with you.

You might think this is “mom’s job.” Well, the truth is, the best way for you to help your daughter transition into womanhood is to get involved. Don’t skip out on this important event in your daughter’s life! Yes, it’s probably going to seem really awkward… you want to show your daughter support; that you’re compassionate and understanding of everything going on in her heart, life and body. When she sees this in you, it’s likely she will become more accepting of the changes and confident as a result.

I know this is a hard one – but you will survive. It’s so worth knowing that your daughter doesn’t feel she has to hide from you or feel embarrassed by you knowing. The more open you can be with your girl; the more honest and transparent you can be – the better off she will be! One of the greatest things you can offer your daughter, especially when she begins her period is your love, approval and acceptance.

Consider celebrating this milestone with an extra-special date night or a meaningful letter or gift. Show her you’re on her team. You.will.be.ok. Remind her that she will always be your little girl and you love her just the same.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>How can I enforce modesty in a way my daughter respects?</i></strong></p>
It’s likely you’ve seen <i>that</i> dad who wore super short shorts out in public to “teach his daughter modesty.” Funny for the rest of us. "Way to go Dad," right? I don’t know about the daughter though. Something was needed to prove his point, but I think intentional public humiliation is not always the best. Point being, encouraging our daughters to be modest can be a great undertaking.

Have you heard this statement? “But DAD… Everyone else is wearing it.” Don’t underestimate your influence when it comes to modesty. Your approval is extremely important to your daughter. Before you resort to the short-shorts method, go shopping with her. I realize this might not be your favorite activity, but the girls seem to respect their fathers more when we are willing to show interest and have an input in the selection process, knowing modest clothing can be very hard to find.

Have her try on the clothes and model for you. Affirm her natural beauty and be cautious in how you address “inappropriate” clothes. Your language and your tone matter to her confidence. Yes, I know you’re in a mall. In a girl’s store. Shopping. Please be patient and tender toward her. Point out the positive, "I really like the color of that shirt - It brings out your eyes. Maybe we can find one in another size."  A little affirmation before your "It's too tight/short/see through..." will help her be more responsive to your opinion.

Along with overseeing your daughter’s closet and shopping trips, it’s important we lead them to the Word to show them God’s perspective on true beauty and modesty as well as the temptations and struggles of men. Without clear standards reinforced by scripture, modesty will become simply rules she resents rather than a lifestyle she embraces.'

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Does my relationship with her mother really affect my daughter? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Yes. Yes it does.  John Wooden is quoted for saying, <i>“The greatest thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.”  </i>In loving her mother well, you’re not only teaching her about love, loyalty, compassion, respect, commitment, trust and tenderness, you are demonstrating it before her very eyes.  You can show her by the way you love and honor your wife that she should never settle for less than that. She will learn from <i>you</i> what qualities to look for and expect in a future husband.

I understand that some of you reading this come from broken relationships. Even if your daughter’s mother is now your ex, there is a godly way to honor her, to speak highly of her, and bless her. Your daughter is watching and she is watching more closely than you think.

If you are currently in a toxic or unhealthy relationship, that is not positively changing or if you’re not receiving counsel, you are essentially telling your daughter that this is <em>ok </em>for her future. If one day your daughter came home and told you she was in a similar relationship being treated the way you (or your wife) is, how would you feel? Would your heart break for her? You’re setting the bar. As the leader of your home, you set the tone and the pace for your wife and your children. I encourage you to genuinely and increasingly love her mother. Treat her with respect and a decent amount of PDA! When your little girl grows up it’s likely she will look for a man who treats her much like the way you treated her mom.

Be the dad that comes home and kisses your wife in front of the kids. They may scream or cover their eyes and say, “Ewwwww” but they will <em>know</em> you love her. Don't let that even  be a question in your child's mind! Your daughter will recognize that she wants a husband like you some day.

Strive to love her mother. Love her well. Love her better each day. Your daughter needs to see love demonstrated. Ready, set, go.'

Hopefully, you're daughter was all tucked into bed when the Grammy's started out with grinding Sunday night, but it's likely that some girls her age—perhaps friends at school—were glued to the television. Pre-show media touted the 2014 Grammy Awards as a family affair. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/table-talk-2014-grammy-awards_n_4660600.html">Huffington Post</a> even offered a table talk guide and ideas to help kids "cultivate the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the contribution of recorded music to American culture."

But what the world saw—from grinding to explicit lyrics to darkly themed performances to a "church" service— was not appropriate for young viewers, and you may need help navigating post-show conversations with your kids whether they saw the show or are just hearing about it from friends. And—whether you realize it or not—there really is something worth talking about.

Her name is Natalie Grant.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Natalie-Grant.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4012 aligncenter" alt="Natalie-Grant" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Natalie-Grant-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

&nbsp;

Grammy-nominated, five-time Dove Award winning recording artist Natalie Grant has found herself in a Hurricane. (Appropriate, due to her current chart-topping song.) She's been assaulted by media attention that's fueled with criticism–and a sprinkling of approval— for leaving the Grammy's. (I can only begin to image what it looks like in the eye of her media hurricane because when I posted a news article about her leaving the Grammy's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dannah-Gresh/204435266257157?ref=hl">my Facebook</a> post was viewed by over six million people! And the nearly 5,000 comments were often heated and divisive.)

Natalie has not publicly stated why she and her husband decided to leave, but was careful to tell people of her choice when she tweeted:
<blockquote><em><strong>@NatalieGrant</strong></em>
(1 of 2) We left the Grammy’s early. I’ve many thoughts, most of which are probably better left inside my head. But I’ll say this:

I’ve never been more honored to sing about Jesus and for Jesus. And I’ve never been more sure of the path I’ve chosen.</blockquote>
I think that Natalie has placed into our hands one of the greatest life lessons your daughter will ever get to see and it's worth talking about. Here are a few important points I'd make when talking to my daughters (or sons).

<strong>1.) Sometimes God's Spirit calls Christians to be in places where He is not welcomed.</strong> A lot of the Christians criticizing Natalie have stated that she shouldn't have been at the Grammy's to begin with. (One pastor, confusing me for Natalie, posted this to my Facebook page:
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">So proud of your stand...</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">now promise to never go to this kind of trash again.</h5>
</blockquote>
That thinking wreaks of legalism and a lack of relying on the Holy Spirit. Sometimes God's Spirit calls us to be light in the darkness.

I remember a time when my Lexi was only twelve years old and I dropped her off at pottery class. The basement studio was small and each week had a new art galleria in the lobby. On this particular night the display was purely Satanic and pointedly spiritual. Sensual sculptures of Adam and Eve. Burned out clay skeletons. And at the back of the gallery a large Bible opened to a page in Revelation. Every word had been blacked out except three which went connected made this sentence: "God. Is. Dead." Everything in me wanted to take Lexi and run. (And to give the owner a piece of my mind.) Instead, I prayed. And God seemed to be telling me to let her stay. I spent then next hour prayer walking the block.

Do you know that the displayed opened up a spiritual conversation during class, particularly of the existence of heaven and hell? And my sweet Lexi, arms deep in slippery clay, lovingly testified of her faith to her Agnostic teacher and a teen in the class who said she was an Atheist.

I think Natalie's work is marked with God's spirit. So she and her husband Bernie probably sensed God giving them a green light to go to the Grammy's. And clearly, while they were sitting in the audience they had an on-going conversation with the Holy Spirit who prompted them to leave. What a great example for our children! How I would have loved to have talked about Natalie's decision with my Lexi when she was twelve.

I've said this before, but let me say it again:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT ABOUT RAISING YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SET APART IN THIS CORRUPT CULTURE, YOU WILL BECOME A PARANOID MOTHER WHOSE LEGALISM DOES NOT ALLOW HER CHILDREN TO FACE THE GIANTS GOD MEANS FOR THEM TO FACE!</p>
</blockquote>
Natalie and her husband faced their own Goliath at the Grammy's. And I think they were called to it. It would be great if the Church gave her an "atta girl" rather than added to the criticism. We can't quiet those that say hurtful things, but what we can do as mothers is teach our daughters to follow in Natalie's footsteps.

<strong>2.) God always asks us to stand against evil. </strong>Turn in your own Bibles to Ephesians 6 and read verses 10-20 with your kids. Have them circle each time the word "stand" is used.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your <strong>stand</strong> against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to <strong>stand</strong> your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. <strong>Stand</strong> firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.</p>
</blockquote>
Explain to your children that when we face (or see) evil, the person or group of people involved isn't the source of evil. ("Our struggle is not with flesh and blood.") Therefore, we aren't called to argue, debate, accuse, or label. That's not what the verse instructs.

Instead, we are simply called to "stand." <strong><em>This is a silent but strong action.</em></strong>

We are also called to fearlessly declare the gospel. That is, the name of Jesus and his love for this lost world. (Again note: we are not called to argue, debate, accuse, or label but to speak the name and love of Christ.)

When Natalie posted what she did on Twitter, she was standing but not name calling or debating. The one name she did honor with verbal affirmation was the name of Jesus. Hers was a display of Ephesians 6 at it's best.

<strong>3.) God does not always require us to speak out against evil.</strong> When Jesus was on the earth the Roman culture was corrupt. King Herod was a brutal, baby-killing murder. The Olympics were a hedonistic, pagan religious festival. Many wanted Jesus to speak out against these things.

He didn't.

He just loved.

It is critical that we have a solid Biblical theology about music, sexuality, occult activity and more. In our Bible studies, church meetings and conferences we SHOULD talk about these things. <strong><em>But do we bring the lost closer to Jesus by telling them that they are bad? Usually not. I've never won someone to Christ by convincing them that they are wrong and I am right</em></strong>.

They come to Christ because they feel loved. By Him through me.

Natalie has chosen not to speak out against any specific songs, lyrics, actions or artists. For those who are trying to make this about one single performance or issue, here is what Natalie posted on her Facebook page Monday:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"I've tried to read all of the comments on my previous post but I can't respond to them all. Most of you have always been so supportive and encouraging to me &amp; I'm grateful. It does sadden me when people argue, judge and hurl insults at each other from both sides of the fence. I'm not going to engage in arguments, but just have a few things I'd like to say:<br data-reactid=".f.1:3:1:$comment578144675609524_3493718:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.0:3.0.3.0.$end:0:$1:0" />I NEVER said I left during any particular performance.

I hate no one. And I believe that every person has been created in the image of God. I will never stand on a street corner and wave a sign, I won't use my platform to engage in political arguments that will only divide and not unite. I will continue to pray that my life will be my message. I do have my own personal convictions that I live by, and I will continue to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord.

<p style="text-align: left;">A brilliant, humble, and well-spoken testimony. Full of the courage to stand and the name of Jesus. Void of name-calling and arguing. This is one "celebrity" our daughter's can learn from. So, let's talk about it with them!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your daughter is going to have friends who are lost. They will act in ways they should not, listen to music that is vulgar, and maybe even make sexual choices that are contrary to God's word.</p>
She will not win them to Jesus unless she loves them.

Our inner city outreach is entirely FREE to moms and daughters in NYC. The first 500 mom/daughter(s) will leave with a bag of FREE resources to bring them closer to each other and to Jesus. This includes a Secret Keeper Girl Mother/Daughter 8 Great Dates Book, A Secret Keeper Girl Bible Study, and a 1 Girl Nation CD. At the end of the night, we minister to these moms and daughters in prayer for as long as they need it. (Here's one of my favorite photos from our first inner city outreach in 2011.)

My team has been trying to get me' at line 1 for query UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = 'I was standing in line to check out at my pharmacy the other day when I saw the most frightening sight. A teeny-tiny barely-there skirt clinging to boney hips was all that stood between me and a clear view of the most skeletally thin legs I'd seen on a grown woman in my life: thigh gap! My team has been trying to get me to blog about it, but until I saw it first hand I didn't realize how horrifying it really can be. The young woman in front of me looked a lot like this photo, which I found at the proud blog of an anorexic.  As unattractive as you might find this, all-too-many tween and teen girls find it appealing...sexy even. And they'll do anything to achieve it. And many girls who obsess about thigh gap, end up struggling with eating disorders.

<em>Think your daughter is to bright to fall for that?</em> You might consider that it's often the brightest and most promising young girls that fall for anorexia.

<em>Think your daughter's too young to fall for that?</em> Anorexia often hits girls in their tween years, not their teen years, with some eating disorder clinic patients being as young as five. (Bulimia tends to hit when a girl is older.)

So let's muscle up our minds, moms! And be brave enough to have real conversations about a real problem. Here are five things you need to discuss with your daughter.

<strong>1.) Ask her if she knows about thigh gap and what she thinks about it?</strong> Your daughter's body condition, the existence or lack of a thigh gap, and conversation about it will not be what clues you in to a problem. In general, girls who loathe their bodies don't wake up one day and say, "Hey, mom. I really hate my body. I think I'll starve myself until I achieve thigh gap. Yeah! A little miserable anorexia sounds just great!" You have to ask. I have two especially thin daughters and we have open conversations about their weight and how they feel about themselves. This always begins with me asking about trends and just hearing their heart on the matter. You might also note if there is a sudden interest in diet or exercise, as sometimes that is a sign of the obsession.

<strong>2.) Explain to her that a thigh gap is not about how skinny a person is, but how their bone structure was formed at birth</strong>. Doctors warn that very few women have the true bone structure that leads to thigh gap naturally and healthfully. I found this great illustration on a <a href="http://fitnesstreats.tumblr.com/post/29683222718/hi-im-on-my-way-to-losing-weight-and-one-of-the">women's health and nutrition site</a>. You might share it with your daughter.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3529 aligncenter" alt="tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>3.) Show her photos of photoshopped thigh gap and explain that it's usually not real.</strong> Then, show her examples of real women in video or photos where you can see how a woman is supposed to look. (No gap!) As much as you'd like to think she never sees these kinds of photos, she probably does. It's better to show them to her and talk about it than to pretend they don't exist.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/21lud1e.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3530 aligncenter" alt="21lud1e" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/21lud1e-300x287.jpg" width="300" height="287" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>4.) Explain to her the risk of reducing body fat to the point of actually having "thigh gap."</strong> Risks include harming your body to the point of creating "brain gap." You better believe it. Losing too much weight can impact your brain, heart, lungs. It can also lead to loss of her period if she's already cycling. Nothing good comes of excessive weight loss.

<strong>5.) Above all, pray!</strong> I remember reading in Beth Moore's "Feather's From My Nest" of the account of praying her daughter <a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/inspirationalteaching/moore_magazines.aspx">Melissa's struggle</a> with an eating disorder. Oh, how that mama prayed. And called down the power of heaven to reduce the stronghold in Melissa's mind to rubble. What a glorious day it was when her daughter realized that she was feasting her eyes on images that were unattainable and unholy and asked her mother to come help her take magazine pages off her bedroom wall! Remember, whatever we worship and dwell on will inform what we believe about ourselves.

At the risk of sounding sacreligious and trite (but, oh, I rely on a lotta laughter to get me through the ugliest stuff), I invite you to share with your daughter these "celebs" who really do have real "thigh gap!" Perhaps that will curb her appetite!

Therefore, I'm often fielding questions on related topics including the HPV vaccination, Gardasil, which the Center For Disease Control recommends for girls and boys aged 11 and 12 (though it can be given as early as year nine). I'm not a medical professional, and you should seek the advice of a variety of professionals in the field before you make a decision because you will find their opinions varied. Here are a few facts and some links to those whose opinion I sought before decided that I would wait a little longer to decide if I will administer the vaccine to my girls. For now, I'm choosing not to do so.

<strong>What is HPV?</strong>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus">HPV</a> is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States of America. It is a common denominator in all cases of cervical cancer. There are approximately 30-40 strains of the virus. The human body is capable of clearing the infection. 70% of cases clear within one year. 90% within two. Of the remaining 10%, about half will experience cervical cancer within 10-15 years. PAP tests are used to detect pre-cancerous cells. Cervical cancer is treatable.

<strong>What is Gardasil?</strong>

<a href="http://www.gardasil.com/">Gardasil</a> is a vaccine that protects users from four of the many strains of HPV. These strains are responsible for about 70-75% of cervical cancer (depending on which source you cite). Seventy percent sounds like a big number so it's important to look at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cervical.htm">risk</a> of cervical cancer more closely. About 8 in 100,000 women experience cervical cancer each year. There are 1.9-3.7 deaths per year per 100,000 women as a result. One death is too many and every effort should be made to prevent these deaths, but questions need to be asked in terms of the efficacy of Gardasil and the risk to each vaccinated user before a final decision should be made for each individual.

<strong>What are the risks of Gardisil?</strong>

The C<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm?s_cid=mm6229a4_w">enter for Disease Control</a> and the World Health Organization stands by its opinion that the drug is safe for use. Their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm?s_cid=mm6229a4_w">reports</a> state that between June 2006 and March 2013,  21,194 recievers of the vaccination reported adverse reactions. Most of these were considered "non-serious." Proponents of the vaccination state the the only weak link in the plan to eliminate cervical cancer is that <a href="http://acsh.org/2013/07/hpv-vaccines-effective-but-vaccination-rates-still-low/">"doctors are failing to encourage their patients to recieve the vaccination."</a> The question must be asked: why?

Many credible American <a href="http://pop.org/content/merck-researcher-admits-gardasil-guards-against-almost-nothing-985">groups</a> have made public statements that the drug is dangerous. Reports of adverse reactions range from dizziness and headaches to seizures. The country of <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041099_Gardasil_side_effect_Japan_infertility.html">Japan</a> has withdrawn its support of the drug. While it will not pull the vaccination, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare no longer recommends the drug and those who receive it must be made well aware of the high risk of adverse reactions. In Japan, there are 1,968 cases that the ministry labels adverse and many are labeled as "severe" including "long term pain and numbness and infertility and paralysis." In August 2013, the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041512_Gardasil_ovary_destruction_HPV_vaccine.html">Australian</a> equivalent of the FDA concluded that the maker of Gardasil did not adequately test the impact of the drug on the reproductive system of women. A report in the <a href="http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2012/bcr-2012-006879.abstract">British Medical Journal</a> reported pre-mature ovarian failure in a sixteen-year-old as a result of the vaccination.

<strong>What Should I Do?</strong>
You should talk to your daughter early and thoroughly about the risk of sex outside of marriage. And before she is sexually active, she needs to consider with you whether or not her behavior puts herself and others at risk of sexually transmitted disease. This decision is not an easy one.

While our mission is the same: to bring the hearts of moms and daughters closer to each other and to Jesus, our content in the Crazy Hair Tour is all-new. I'm happy to share a few critical differences with you, but first let me assure you that our mission is being accomplished. One mom wrote in this week to tell us how much she loved the new event and wrote this: "I asked my daughter her favorite thing about the show. Her response: “I don’t know, it was all fun. I guess that I feel closer to you now. I don’t know why, I just do.” My heart is beating right out of my chest with joy! Here are some other cool things you need to know about the new event:

<strong>1.) <a href="http://www.1girlnation.com/">1 Girl Nation</a> is currently touring with us.</strong> This new group of five twenty-somethings who love Jesus "like crazy" (and have a song to prove it) are fantastic role models with some serious pipes. Disillusioned with Miley? Throw her music out. You won't need it after your daughter meets Kayli, Lauryn Taylor, Lindsey, Kelsey, and Carmen. <strong><em>We have integrated them right into the event, but you'll want to come half an hour early to hear their pre-show concert.</em></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1GN.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3395" alt="1GN" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1GN-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2.) The new theme encourages girls to denounce being normal (read: boy-crazy, obsessed with beauty, mean girls, etc) and embrace the idea of being totally God-crazy.</strong> My heart has been so burdened with the growing pressure for our little girls to grow up too fast and to follow the empty-headed crowd. If they do, the role models they feast upon with be Miley Cyrus and the behavior will have them looking like they are seventeen when they are seven. Someone had to sound an alarm, inviting them to stick out for Jesus. As I prayed, I remembered a verse that my dear friend and board member Laurel Mench handed me once. I have treasured it in my Bible since she gave it to me. II Corinthians 5:13-21 reads "If I acted crazy, I did it for God...Christ's love has moved me to such extremes. his love has the first and last word in everything we do." It became an anthem for our team as we developed the script for the Crazy Hair Tour. The teaching surrounding this verse is meaty. And your daughters will memorize it by the end of the night. That was very important to us as we prayed. We hope they go on to internalize this truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BibleMemory.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3397 aligncenter" alt="BibleMemory" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BibleMemory-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3.) All-new stories and lessons featuring a fan favorite from the start: <em>The Chicken Who Wanted To Be A Peacock.</em></strong> Even this story, based on a true story about Napoleon the Peacock who lives on my farm, calls girls out to be crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peacock.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3398 aligncenter" alt="Peacock" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peacock-300x156.jpg" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5.) The It's Sew Crazy Fashion Show is new and different.</strong> Get your needle and thread out and get ready for the It's SEW Crazy Fashion Show. Each outfit was modified using a simple mother/daughter sewing project. We will be posting those crafts here in September and October so you have a fun project to complete when you get home. (If ya want!) The outfit below was created using iron on decals. (Can you say "simple?") And that's my precious niece Rebecca in the photo!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3401 aligncenter" alt="543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4.) And, of course, there's lots of crazy hair!</strong> A favorite part of the Pajama Party Tour was wearing fuzzy slippers and pjs. Leave them at home or you'll look...well, crazy. (So it could work, after all.) But you can certainly wear your crazy hair and many moms are saying this is the best part of the night. "My daughter and I had so much fun going to the store to pick up crazy things for our hair and spent a whole hour in the bathroom laughing before we left for the event. Thank you for that time," wrote one mom!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3399 aligncenter" alt="1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, whad'ya say? Get crazy with us and help us build an army of girls who are so God-crazy, that the boy crazy train drives right on past! Here's our upcoming <a href="http://purefreedom.org/tour/">tour schedule</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. I don't appear at the Secret Keeper Girl live events. I am still trying to raise my own precious girls. Though they are young adults, I can't be on the road as much as would be demanded. I sure hope I get to meet you someday as I do make frequent speaking engagements. You'll absolutely love my team.</p>' WHERE meta_id = 23557 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

Forty percent of girls starting their periods have never heard about it from their own parents. Can you imagine how frightening it could be to wake up with bloodstained sheets or be horrified in the school bathroom and not have a clue what it means?

Let's make sure you punctuate your daughter's period with lots of enthusiasm and excitement rather than silence! Here is how you can talk to her in the right time and with the right attitude:

<strong>Prepare for the Conversation Years in Advance</strong>

Yes, begin teaching Sex Ed 101. I started these lessons with Rob and Lexi when they were in pre-school by talking to them about flowers. "You see," I would tell them as we looked into a lily, "even flowers have a daddy part (the pistil) and a mommy part (the stamen)." God created everything to make life. Even flowers! Get started as soon as you can with these simple life lessons and they will come much more naturally. Your willingness to talk openly about such topic ensures that your children will be able to come to YOU for answers.

<strong>Watch for the First Sign of Puberty</strong>

Your daughter's first period is the onset of puberty! There is something that happens one or two years before that. It's the sign to look for. Do you know what that is? Hint: She's got two and so do you! There ya go - you've got it! Breast buds.

&nbsp;

Your daughter's first period is <em>not</em> the onset of puberty! There is something that happens one or two years before that. It's the sign to look for. Do you know what that is? Hint: She's got two and so do you! There ya go - you've got it! Breast buds.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stages-puberty-female.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-6799"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6799 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stages-puberty-female-300x159.jpg" alt="stages puberty female" width="300" height="159" /></a>Medical journals say that the average girl experiences the first sign of breast buds at 10.7 years, give or take a little. Every girl develops at her own pace, so be prepared for anything. About 15% of girls experience both breast buds and pubic hair before eight years old, which means they are probably set to menstruate between their ninth and tenth birthday. Even if you are surprised at how soon it happens, <em>she </em>shouldn't be!

<strong>Tell Her About Her Period Between Her Eighth and Tenth Birthdays</strong>

The average age at which a girl has her first period is 12.7 years. This age can deviate by as much as a year and a half. So be prepared to talk to her no later than age nine. Here are two things you can do to make it easy to talk to her about.... "happy week"!

1. Tell her by using pictures of life.

Many moms talk about the basic function of periods, but fail to talk about <em>why</em> we have them. Having a period is God's great sign that he's preparing your daughter to be a mom one day! Here is where you have the wonderful opportunity to use your daughter's entrance into womanhood as a value-formation tool on the wonder of being a mom. <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-in-utero-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-6802"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6802 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-in-utero-2-300x225.jpg" alt="baby-in-utero-2" width="300" height="225" /></a>This transition is so critical for our daughters in this day and age. The feminine quality of motherhood has been under attack, and our daughters are losing. In a 2007 survey over over 1200 Christian teens, the vast majority of them did not want to be mothers and felt motherhood should be a goal secondary to the dreams they had for a career. How sad!

Start with the pictures and then accompany them with any of your specific thoughts about carrying your daughter in your womb, if you had that honor. Read Psalm 139 with your daughter during this time of conversation. This chapter gives you the wonderful opportunity to begin a dialogue to form your daughter's values about <em>true beauty</em> and the value of <em>motherhood</em>.

2. Give her a gift basket with all the necessary supplies. <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/periodpackswtamponsandchoc.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2147 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/periodpackswtamponsandchoc-233x300.jpg" alt="periodpackswtamponsandchoc" width="233" height="300" /></a>

Purchase or put together a <a href="http://www.periodpacks.com/gifts/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=1">cute basket</a> and stuff it full of girl things such as: a new bra, mini-pads, regular pads, teen-formula pain pills, body spray,  books, chocolate, Thermacare menstrual heat wraps, and a letter welcoming her to womanhood.  Also consider including a small zippered canvas or fabric bag that's filled with the basics so she can discreetly take it to school. She might think you are "making a big deal about it," but I guarantee you, she would much rather you celebrate with her and give gifts than her be alone in the bathroom stall at school!

Along with the basket should come a mini-lesson on how to use it all. And, if anyone should happen to twirl a tampon or stick a pad to their forehead, just take a deep breath and laugh!

What do you do, though, when she does start needing one? Let's be realistic. A nine-year-old doesn't need padding. But it can be tricky to find something appropriate for the little girl that you want her to stay, and you busy moms don’t have the time to drag her into every store at the mall.

Summer is quickly approaching and that means the dreaded swimsuit shopping adventure. Let’s just face it. Swimsuits are not modest, period. Nothing about them is. But if you’re going to the beeaaaach (sung to the tune of “rolling in the deep”) this summer, keep these Secret Keeper Girl tips in mind.
<ul>
	<li>Swimwear is for SWIMMING. Swimsuits are fine for jumping in the ocean or pool, but a Secret Keeper Girl covers up when she gets out. “Laying out” may be okay with girlfriends, but not when there are guys around. Whether it’s a pair of board shorts and T-shirt or a fun frilly cover-up, your girls have lots of adorable options!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Focus on what they CAN purchase. Do a bit of online perusing and show your girls some suits you think are modest. We’re partial to tankinis, especially ones with shorts (they’re usually less form-fitting than a one-piece; we’ve had success at places like Kohl’s and some sporting goods stores since athletic suits tends to cover more territory). Set the standard by showing them that modest swimwear can be cute. When you are teaching your girls about modesty, it’s crucial to show them what you can say “yes” to, or all they hear is “no” and that can crush their spirits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Discuss your expectations BEFORE you hit the mall. What mom says goes. As a general rule, we see NO reason for sheer fabric, bikinis, plunging necklines, or high-cut hips. (Of course, sharing an embarrassing moment to prove your point always adds some credibility!</li>
</ul>
And of course, don’t forget to finish off the trip by picking up some super-cool nail polish and stopping in for some refreshing summer smoothies.

For more modesty boosting ideas as we head into the warmer months, <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/tour/">come to the Secret Keeper Girl Crazy Hair Show</a> where we discuss our Truth or Bare Fashion Tests during our LIVE fashion show! You seriously won't want to miss!

This one is so simple, that it's a great recipe to teach your daughter measuring and mixing. It makes for some really fun mother/daughter kitchen time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Lemon Moon Cookies</strong>

1 box lemon cake mix

2 cups Cool Whip topping

1 egg, beaten

2 T. lemon juice

Mix all of the above ingredients together. The mixture will be like a sticky pizza dough though not stretchy. Take a teaspoon full of batter and drop it into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Then, put the sugar dipped drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 11 minutes. Let cool before letting them melt in your mouth!

It can print as a one-sided piece. Or you can opt to download a backside and then the piece can be folded to 8.5' x 5.5' and tabbed for direct mailing.

They are presented two per 8.5x11 sheet and can be laser printed. You may use our full color or black and white option. If you print in black and white we recommend hot pink paper! Our designers and printers have stated that this quality should work whether you print on a laser printer or whether you take it to a commercial printer. Enjoy the ease!

Originally, Secret Keeper was a book for teen girls about how to keep the deepest secrets of your beauty for just one man. It was very successful and we chose to use that name to approach teens in an age appropriate way about issues of modesty and purity. It is certainly not our intent to encourage girls to be secretive. You'll see our events and resources are a way to get moms and girls talking, talking, talking about everything!

Our popular books and events help moms cultivate God-crazy daughters who embrace inner beauty and biblical truths. Secret Keeper Girl live events bring mothers and daughters are filled with fun activities, dance parties, fashion shows and more - while saving time and space for important conversations that bring them closer to each other and Christ!

<div id="aboutIntro">

The Secret Keeper Girl Truth or Bare Fashion Tests were developed as a fun way for a girl and her mom to think about what she's wearing and monitor outfits for modesty. Often, cut-and-dry rules such as, <strong>"Your skirt should be two inches below the knee"</strong> and  <strong>"Your shorts need to come to the tips of your fingers"</strong>  are not always effective simply because each girl's body is unique! These tests have different results for every body type, age, and mind. We hope the suggested Truth or Bare guidelines help a girl think for herself as she comes to recognize the types of clothing that are modest - specific to her own body and fashion sense!

<h2>Test #1: Spring Valley</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> "Is my shirt too tight?"

<strong>Action:</strong> Take the tips of your fingers and press into your shirt, right where your ribs come together in the "valley" in the middle of your chest. When you take your fingers away, does your shirt immediately spring back like a small Smurf trampoline? If so, your shirt is too tight!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Try a different bra, since sometimes that can make a difference. But if it's still too tight get rid of that shirt. Buy your shirts based on fit, not size, because sizes can differ from brand to brand.</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Am I showing too much belly?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Stand up straight and raise both arms high in the air, like you are pointing up to Heaven. Is this exposing any belly? If so, your mom has permission to poke it!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Visit the men’s or boy’s department and buy a simple ribbed tank top (they often come in packages of three) to wear under your funky short T’s and crop tops or with your trendy low-riding jeans. Layering is an easy way to solve the belly problem!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Can you see my underpants”

<strong>Action:</strong> Bend over and touch your knees. Have your mom or a girl friend look at your bottom. Can she see the outline of your underpants? Can she see what color they are? How about your actual underwear because your pants are so low that you’re risking pulling a “plumber” exposure?

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> If your pants are so tight that you can see the outline of your panties, try buying pants one size larger! Wear flesh-tone panties with white or very light pants.</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “How short is too short?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Get in front of a full-length mirror. If you are wearing shorts, sit down criss-cross applesauce. If you’re in a skirt, sit in a chair with your legs crossed, applesauce. If you’re in a skirt, sit in a chair with your legs crossed, ladylike. Now, what do you see in the mirror? If you see undies, or lots of thigh, your shorts or skirt is too short!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Buy longer shorts and skirts! We know that due to today’s fashions, these can sometimes be hard to find. Fix the length problem by adding a pair of funky, bright-colored tights under your shorts and too-short skirts!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #5: The Plumbers Test</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Are my pants too low?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Sit cross-legged on the floor and bend over as if you are about to devour a great magazine. Now reach behind you and feel what might be the featured view if your pants are too low. (Or get your mom or a girlfriend to take a look!)

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> This is usually an easy fix with the Secret Weapon: a men’s tank or T-shirt, but be willing to consider that some low riders are just too low. Find a pair that won’t cause viewers to blush!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #6: Bra-lliant Idea</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is it cold in here?”

<strong>Action:</strong> When we get cold or nervous we tend to “get nippy”… if you catch my drift. When this happens, it is visible to others if our bras are not thick enough. There is no real test for this one (at least not one that I would want to take!)

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> When you are wearing thinner shirts, wear a thicker bra. When you are wearing a sweater or thicker shirt, go for the thin and cute bra if you want!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #7: Stand in the Gap</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is my button-down shirt too tight?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Button down your shirt and stand sideways looking in the mirror. If any of the spaces between the buttons is gaping open, even just a little, you’re in danger of exposing way too much, and in danger of losing a button!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Try buying a size or two larger (if that number on the tag bothers you, just cut out the tag when you get home!) Or, try wearing a shirt under your button down and leave it unbuttoned for a layered look. Modesty is not just about how much of your beautiful epidermis is showing, but how much of your shape is showing!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is my shirt too low?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Take your hand and put your thumb in that little shelf under your neck (I have no idea what it is called, Collarbone maybe? Just feel around, you’ll find it.) Is there any skin showing below your hand? If so, you seriously need to rethink this shirt.

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Our Secret Weapon (the T-Shirt or tank) works for low shirts as well as short shirts! You can also go for a trendy layered look by putting a button down under a polo or rugby shirt that plunges too low.</em>[/fusion_text][/three_fourth][one_fourth last="yes" spacing="yes" center_content="no" hide_on_mobile="no" background_color="" background_image="" background_repeat="no-repeat" background_position="left top" hover_type="none" link="" border_position="all" border_size="0px" border_color="" border_style="" padding="" margin_top="" margin_bottom="" animation_type="" animation_direction="" animation_speed="0.1" animation_offset="" class="" id=""][imageframe lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" style_type="none" hover_type="none" bordercolor="#29b4c6" bordersize="5px" borderradius="round" stylecolor="" align="none" link="" linktarget="_self" animation_type="zoom" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.8" animation_offset="" hide_on_mobile="no" class="" id=""] <img src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/palm-pilot.jpg" alt="" />[/imageframe][/one_fourth][/fullwidth]' WHERE meta_id = 22615 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

This gift also reaches these girls at a critical time. <strong>90% of kids in America </strong>will form their <em>lifelong</em> values and beliefs... their FAITH... by their 13th birthday. Just 13!

Surrounded by young girls becoming “physically” active by age 11, a high rate of “physical” abuse, and excessive immodesty Danet Panton-Fuller sensed great risk for her precious daughters: Zariah, Andazi, and Azariah. She wanted desperately for them to rise above the statistics of The Projects.
<div class="g2glarge">

<strong>Moms and daughters living in these poverty pockets are not able to purchase Secret Keeper Girl event tickets or books and resources to use as tools to reduce these risks. We feel called to find a way to bring them to them at no cost.</strong>

</div>
Having never met Danet, God’s Spirit spoke to me about this for the first time in 2011 and called us to do a free event in the Bronx and to give the moms who attended free books to help them disciple their girls in true beauty, modesty and purity.  Today, Danet’s daughters are passionately seeking God’s best for their life as they find their joy and strength in Jesus.

We are looking forward to writing more great stories like this one as we reach out to poverty-stricken regions all across the US. This year we are headed to poverty pockets in Belle Glade, FL, East Liverpool, OH, and Richmond, VA.

Pray it forward and gift your memorable SKG experience to others.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret Keeper Girl is the most fun a mom and daughter will have digging into God's word together! In a world where culture is targeting young girls with the pressures of growing up too fast, Secret Keeper Girl is a ministry dedicated to enabling moms to connect to their daughters and raise a generation of girls who love Jesus, know their value, and are ready to navigate culture with those things in mind. Secret Keeper Girl resources and live events are filled with fun activities, dance parties, fashion shows and more – all aimed at getting moms and daughters talking about Christ-centered definitions of true beauty and modesty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2002, Dannah Gresh wrote "Secret Keeper: The Delicate Power of Modesty." It soon became a handbook for the modesty movement across the nation, encouraging teen girls to keep the deepest secrets of their beauty for one man. But while raising her own daughter, Dannah realized that in today's culture TWEEN girls are being targeted with pressures that their mom's didn't face until high school.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wanting to keep her little girl from growing up too fast, she knew that she needed to instill the values of true beauty and modesty before those teen years. Mascara, spaghetti straps, training bras, and all the other danger zones of being a girl: Dannah gathered her daughter and her friends together for a Christ-centered, tween-friendly study on the topic of what it means to be a godly girl. This was the start of Secret Keeper Girl.</span></p>
<p class="p1">And as it turns out, a lot of moms are seeing their daughters face the pressure of growing up too fast! Since starting Secret Keeper Girl, Dannah Gresh has released more than 25 books for moms and their tweens, and Secret Keeper Girl live events have helped over 200,000 moms and daughters begin conversation about the deepest secrets of their beauty and value. Secret Keeper Girl has become the nation's number one tool for connecting moms and their tween daughters to each other and to Christ.</p>

<strong>FACT #1: Our brain is called MasterTour.</strong> Coordinating up to 50 tour stops in three months with a tour team of up to 12 and an off-road management team of only 4 takes a brain. And we have one. It's called MasterTour.

Only He knew that the gracious owner of that RV would later offer to buy us a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/08txi9of5r2k274/AABBc0kHmqTQdfHKT_M6hmYxa?dl=0">BRAND-NEW BUS</a>! <img class="size-medium wp-image-6298 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4902-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4902" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the start of the Spring 2015 tour season, we were rolling with style in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/08txi9of5r2k274/AABBc0kHmqTQdfHKT_M6hmYxa?dl=0">beautiful gift of a bus we decided to name Providence so we always remember the Lord's hand in giving it to us</a>. The bus is our home-away-from-home and this new one is spacious and was newly renovated inside so it is super comfy! Stephanie, our wonderful bus driver, drives the team from city to city while they sleep in one of the 12 bunks onboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">**Be sure to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secretkeepergirl">follow us on Facebook</a> because on our days off, we love to have friends like YOU come and hang out with us on the bus!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #3: We blow up a lot of balloons each morning.</strong> Each event requires stage set up that takes us about 3 hours. No one gets the morning off. We all help set up lighting, sound equipment, staging pipe and drape, the resource table signs and banners, books, and lots and lots of balloons. The balloon sculptures for the stage take about an hour and require several volunteers from our host church (whom we love so much) managed by one team member who handles our 7' crazy hair column topper with expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons.png"><img class=" wp-image-4762 alignleft" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons-300x252.png" alt="Balloons" width="240" height="202" /></a>
<em>Last year we spent about 80 hours blowing up 17,760 balloons.</em></p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #5: We manage a lot of clothes and props backstage.</strong> From the world's largest chicken egg to a complete set of authentic vintage clothing from four different decades, our stage team manages all of its own props. We put them out in the morning and do a careful accounting of each item at the end of each night. Heather (vintage clothing coordinator) and Jordan ("It's Sew Crazy" tween fashion show designer) are seen below organizing one of our wardrobes from a former season.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4766 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n-300x225.jpg" alt="312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Crazy Hair Tour uses 111 props each night including the world's largest sling shot! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #6: Every day we do a sound check.</strong> The last thing we do before daily team devos and lunch is our sound check. We're usually excited by this point because it means we're almost to the part of the day that we get "off." From about noon to four we get to hang out in our bus home or get a shower in a local hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6865.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6301 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6865-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_6865" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The worship team having way too much fun during sound check! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #7: We eat at midnight.</strong> They say that being on stage for one hour is the equivalent of a 4 hour workout. Since we're on stage for nearly three hours, we are starving by the time the bus is loaded up and our pjs (comprised of sweat pants and sweat shirts) are on. We have been known to eat burgers the size of our heads (Lexi) and pizza no less worth talking about (Suzy) at midnight which is when we roll on out of one city and head to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger.png"><img class=" wp-image-4768 alignleft" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger-294x300.png" alt="Burger" width="283" height="288" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year our food budget was $11,799. (We eat less than the bus, that's for sure!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After our midnight snack, it's off to bed in our trusty tour bus. And on to the next city to do it all over again! Can't wait to see YOU this tour season!! ❤</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/crazyhair.php">Secret Keeper Girl stage team</a> recently had the awesome opportunity to join a group of mothers and daughters who are going through an ‘</span><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/search?q=8+great+dates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8 Great Dates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ book. The topic of the week - MEAN GIRLS. After introductions were made, the group discussion things progressed slowly as everyone was unsure of how honest and open they could be. But as our hearts opened up and the conversation picked up steam, we all learned three very important lessons from each other about friendship and mean girls.</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     1. We use the phrase “mean girls” all of the time, but could our frequent use of the term be causing us to miss other potentially toxic friendships that are all along the spectrum? Take the SKG team for example - to break the ice, each girl shared about her friendship experiences. Starting at the beginning of the line, we had the bully, who said mean things and acted in unkind ways while growing up. To her right was the girl who was neither a mean girl nor a bully; she just kind of got along with everyone. Up next was the girl who had been hurt by bullies. When she was growing up, she had all types of mean things said to her and didn’t have good friend. Lastly there was one more girl, who had a unique experience that isn’t often discussed. When she was younger, she found herself in a friendship she <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thought</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was good but really wasn’t. She was very young and so confused that even when she found herself lying to her mother about this girl, it didn’t register that the friendship wasn’t the best thing for her. Even though her friend wasn’t being a stereotypical “mean girl”, she certainly wasn’t being a good friend. All this to say, it’s important to focus on what makes a good friend and what doesn’t and not just “mean girls”.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">     2. Most of us are quite familiar with the quote “before you judge me, walk a mile in my shoes,” but how often do we teach our daughters to really do this? As our group talked, the girl who was was a bully shared that her meanness stemmed from having to experience a death in her family at a very young age. Another mom shared that her daughter had dealt with a bully and over time, it came out that the mean girl had a lot of difficulties in her life. Now please don’t think we’re saying that meanness is ok if someone has a sad enough excuse. No, those who are mean still have to take responsibility for their actions. What we're saying is that <em>a lot </em>of times, there is pain behind the meanness. Which leads us to say this... </span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     3. ‘Be holy’ (1 Peter 1:16)… Oh man, this is so good to talk about and it’s “easy” to do when things are great and you’re in the midst of a good friendship group. But what about when you’re the one being bullied at school? What about when it’s your feelings that are being hurt and it’s you or your daughter who comes home crying? What about when things get so bad that you or your child doesn’t even want to go to school? Yeah, that’s when the command to be holy as our Father is holy is like ‘really, Jesus? You ask way too much!’</span></li>
</ol>
Guess what? He DOES ask too much! But He never asks it without promising to help us by doing whatever He’s asking us to do <i>THROUGH </i>us! Loving your bully, praying for them, forgiving them is NOT easy and you know why? Because it’s NOT natural! It’s not normal. It’s supernatural. It’s CRAZY, something that <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/crazyhair.php">we are all about here at Secret Keeper Girl</a>! And it’s something that can ONLY be done with supernatural help and with through the Holy Spirit’s working in our hearts and minds. In friendships, holiness can take on many different forms; it all depends on what the Spirit is leading you to do, which is why it’s imperative to seek His face in times like these. Holiness could mean distancing yourself. The Bible says “make <em>every effort</em> to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.” (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>, NIV)  Sometimes to keep the peace, you need to distance yourself a la Lot and Abraham in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013">Genesis 13</a>. Holiness could also mean the Spirit leading you or your daughter to trying to befriend whoever is causing you trouble. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a> says “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you…” (KJV) It is so not <span style="font-weight: 400;">normal to “love", "bless", "do good to" or "pray for" </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone who is making your life hard, but by doing these things the Lord could soften the hearts of your bully, give you an opportunity to make a good friend, and maybe even lead them to Himself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a good friend and being involved in good friendships can happen in a myriad of ways. The bottom line </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be found in the latter part of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>. It’s written above. Did you catch it? “<em>...Without holiness no one will see the Lord</em>.” This is what life is all about for the believer - living in such a way so that people are seeing the Lord, people are seeing Jesus. It’s important to realize and remember that <strong>as Christ-followers </strong></span><strong><i>everything</i> about us, even our friendships, should simply be ways in which the world can <i>SEE JESUS</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Make efforts towards peace for Jesus. Be a good friend for Jesus. Love your bullies for Jesus. It’s not about us and it is all about Him.</span>

You hear names like Jacob and David more often than Jessica and Emily in after-school conversations? Is this a good thing, bad thing or is she just a tomboy?

Early dating relationships, teen sex without consequences and a constant diet of boy-crazines is marketed to our daughters through movies, television shows, books, music and advertising. You and I have to be countercultural if we are going to protect our little girls and teach them to approach guy-girl relationships in a holy and age-appropriate manner!

It is not innaproraite or uncommon for your daughter to have multiple guy friends; especially if she is a bit more "rough and tumble," preferring a ball to a ballet slipper! Mom, even as adults we can admit that guys are not as caddy, they don't hold grudges and just roll with the punches. Your daughter is befriending them for the same reasons you did!

Well monitored, co-ed play dates are certainly appropriate and can be beneficial to your daughter. But, somewhere between the ages of 8-12 something shifts. She goes from having a guy pal to wanting a boyfriend. Some might think it's cute for girls to have multiple <em>boyfriends</em> while they are in the 5th grade. However, if your daughter develops the pattern of "needing" a guy when she's eight or nine, she could be heading for multiple long-term relationships in her teen years. That's not wise. Let's help her stay off the boy-crazy train!

You can do this by carefully monitoring her friendships with boys. Listen closely as she talks about her guy friends and the fun they have together. When her heart begins to shift - and you will see it - that may be the time to redefine her friendships with boys. By no means does this include writing them off! It may just mean they don't need to be alone together to play video games. Rather than hanging out in your basement alone, you can send them with a group of friends to the park. Encourage friendships with girls who have similar interests.

Encourage your daughter's father and other men in her life to step up to be the ones she throws the ball with! Countless studies have proven that the more involved a father figure is, the less likely she is to engage in early dating relationships and sexual activity. Admonish Dad, Brother, Uncle, etc. to take her on a hike or bike ride, go fishing, play ball, attend a sporting event or fancy dinner.

Remain in close communication with your daughter about all of her friendships, especially those with boys. Ask her how she feels about herself, boys, and relationships. Then you get to respond to those emotions and direct them with more questions. Pray with your daughter for any guys in her life she considers her friend. Ask that God help her approach those relationships in ways that honor Him.

By the time a girl is eleven, 30% of her peers will have had a boyfriend. Since this drive to be in a relationship only escalates, it's important to talk to your daughter before it happens. If she is already at the "boyfriend" phase, read our <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/featured/how-do-i-talk-to-my-daughter-about-dating/">blog</a> on how to talk to her about dating.'

So many dresses today give off the not-so-little girl vibe. We want a look for our girls that says <em>sweet</em> and <em>innocent</em> rather than <em>growing up too fast</em>. However, many dresses that are little girl appropriate are often lack-luster when it comes to style.

Want to add some color to your dress? How about some bling? Adding simple embellishments can take your dress from dull to designer in a matter of minutes!

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_7744.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3494 aligncenter" alt="IMG_7744" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_7744-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Does your girl love rhinestones, sequins and bling? Help your daughter sew some along the hem of her dress or along the neckline for a touch of fancy. Is she funky and expressive? Let her pick out some themed buttons for a unique style spin.

This grey dress appears in the Secret Keeper Girl Crazy Hair Tour It's Sew Crazy Fashion Show. We felt it was a bit drab on its own so we added a collar of buttons!

It’s a BIG deal to be a girl! It’s a big deal to be a boy and that’s pretty cool, huh? Which leads up to number 2!</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. God created us male and </span><b><i>female</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reflect His image. (vs 27)
</span>The absolute best part of God’s design was Adam and Eve, man and woman. You may be wondering why God chose two different biological sexes to represent Him? How does being a boy or a girl help us reflect God’s image? That’s a big question so does everyone have their thinking caps on? Let’s dive in!
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that God is actually three distinctly different persons in one? Do you know Who they are? Yes, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, which is why He’s known as the trinity (“tri” means 3, incase you didn’t know, so He is 3 in 1.) The Hebrew word in the Bible for this unity of the trinity is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This word refers to marriage, when a man and a woman coming together in union reflects how God comes together in the trinity. Genesis 2:24 says that a man and a woman will become one (echad) flesh. A man and a woman are two distinctly different, independent humans, but when they come together, they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just like God the trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is heavy-duty brain food, but we think that you’re capable of handling it all!! ?</span></li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Looking like God is a </span><b><i>process</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (2 Corinthians 3:18)
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This verse says that we are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transformed to look more like God. We don’t come out already looking like God. It’s not just because you were born a girl that you look like God. And it’s not just once you get married that you’ll </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like God. We are still being made to look more and more like God as we follow Jesus. He started with the fact that you are a girl, and He continues working in your heart to reflect Him every day. Does anyone out there think that they are completely perfect in every single itty bitty way? No, none of us are perfect! We don’t look exactly like God because we’re human and humans have sin, but every day that we follow Jesus and learn more about how to be like Him, we become a better and better reflection of Him.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You start to look more and more like Jesus through praying, and studying His Word, by doing what He says, and by loving him in your heart. Being a girl is a GREAT reflection of Him. But don’t stop there! Be loving, and kind, and obedient. Sometimes this means cleaning your room when you would really just rather be watching TV, or choosing to be nice to someone at school who wasn’t nice to you. Reflect God well by being a GIRL who wants to be like JESUS.</span>
<blockquote>Prayer Time: <span style="font-weight: 400;">In what way(s) are you struggling to look like Jesus? Maybe it’s obeying your parents, or being nice at school. Maybe it’s lying or cheating on a test. Maybe it’s not trying to be like Jesus, or telling teeny tiny lies that you think you can get away with. Daughters, tell your moms the top #1 way that you struggle to be a reflection of God. Then, moms, take a minute to pray over your girls.</span>

Monthly Challenge: This assignment is all about making your girl’s heart beautiful aka making it more like Jesus'. This month I want you to celebrate being a girl with your daughter and her closest friends by doing our FREE mother-daughter Spring date.

If you joined us at the Secret Keeper Girl ‘Crazy Hair Tour’ you would remember the sound of 100’s of sweet little girls singing “Jesus Loves Me” with one voice as some made a first time commitment to Christ.

Since 2010, over 5,256 girls at Secret Keeper Girl events have come forward with their moms to commit their lives to Christ. [1] On average, a girl comes to Christ every 9 hours through Secret Keeper Girl. Every girl has a story. All of them precious-- just like this one.
<blockquote>Today my daughter had a bad day at school and then took the bad home with her to her sister and me. She cried and broke down. I... wanted to cry and break down! We decided to squeeze in Secret Keeper Girl tonight at the last minute. She mumbled on the way, "Today is the WORST day ever!" However, tonight at SKG, God led me to share the gospel with my daughter again. But this time was different! She got into the car and exclaimed, "This time I felt Him! Jesus is in my heart! Tomorrow's going to better because I have Jesus to help me!" As we drove home, she exclaimed, "This is the BEST day ever!” God has a way to make bad always turn to good! She cried! I cried! Today was the BEST day ever with my tween!</blockquote>
The reality is that nearly half of all Americans who accept Jesus Christ as their Savior do so before reaching the age of 13. What these girls “believe by their thirteenth birthday is generally what they will die believing” (Barna Research). [2] That’s why I’m so passionate to reach them before they conform to the new “normal” for 10 year-olds -- - push-up bras, sexy dolls, and mascara sales.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/frostine.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-7266"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7266 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/frostine-300x169.jpg" alt="frostine" width="300" height="169" /></a>The early sexualization of our little girls is totally out of control. For example, the average age of an eating disorder clinic patient has dropped from 15 to 10 and 66% of underweight girls think they’re fat. Even the toys you and I grew up with are getting sexy makeovers. Remember Princess Frostine from Candy Land? Well, look at her now.

&nbsp;

Research is clear that the greatest risk reducer for these girls is mother/daughter connectedness. Because of that, I’m excited to debut the all-new Secret Keeper Girl ‘<span style="color: #8600bb;">Purple Party Tour</span>’ on August 18th. The new show will be even more effective in equipping moms with proven tools to teach their girls the secrets of true beauty and biblical modesty and will cultivate more priceless moments between mom, daughter and Jesus.
<p style="text-align: left;">We’ll also teach girls a loving, biblical view of gender in a safe, age-appropriate manner. What could be more important during a summer when people are petitioning Disney to make Frozen’s beloved Elsa gay in an upcoming sequel? [3]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #8600bb;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Our work is crucial.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #8600bb;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Our “ask” is simple.</span></strong></span></p>
I really need your help to create opportunities for girls to hear truth at the Secret Keeper Girl ‘<span style="color: #8600bb;">Purple Party Tour</span>’. The cost of bringing a new show and curriculum to life is about $100,000. Our goal is to raise that by July 15th. Friends like you help girls experience pure freedom their whole lives as long as we teach them the secrets of true beauty and modesty.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>At nearly every event, people tell us, “If only this had been around when I was young I might not have known the hurts that I know.”</strong></h3>
Because of your faithfulness, Secret Keeper Girl has been there at the exact right time for more than 150,000 girls. Together, we can help them prevent the pain so many of us felt for far too long. I’m asking you to walk alongside us to reach even more moms and daughters with the message of Pure Freedom. Here are some specific ways to help.

Look any and just about everywhere and you will see a huge debate over how girls should be girls. Girl who are girly girls, tomboys, and those who are a fabulous mix of both, are often ridiculed by peers and society. There are a lot of opinions out there BUT what does God, the one who has the first and last say in everything actually have to say? We spent our last Girl Gab Bible Study diving into His Word because it has some pretty cool and important things to say about girls and why no matter if they .... they are all His masterpieces who reflect His glory.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have your daughter open her Bible to Genesis 1 and read verses 26-31. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. You were created in God’s <i>image</i> and that’s very good! (vs 31)
</span>According to verse 31, you weren’t created in the image of your mother, father, or grandparents, regardless of whose nose you might spot on the front of your face. You were created in the image of GOD, and He says that is “very good”. It might be because we make God visible or known (we glorify Him) by looking like Him. We were created IN HIS IMAGE to GLORIFY Him. The Bible talks about a very specific way that we glorify Him, and it’s awesome. See, we have all kinds of talents and skills — from being able to play sports to singing well to being very good at art — but the best way for us represent the wonder of God and look like Him is through our roles as male and female. It’s a BIG deal to be a girl! It’s a big deal to be a boy and that’s pretty cool, huh? Which leads up to number 2!

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. God created us male and <i>female</i> to reflect His image. (vs 27)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn on the television, scroll on any social media site, open any magazine and you’ll see it. You may even feel it. The pressure circulating females today is palpable. We are expected to look a certain way, dress a certain way, speak a certain way - it’s maddening! With all of these opposing and oftimes off-base opinions screaming, “come over this way and join us!”, it’s no wonder that your tween may feel a little odd at times as she struggles to find out who she is and why God created her the way she is. The confusion sometimes goes deep! From the ages of 9-16, I knew I was a female who was made in the image of God, and that I was a child of God because I’d accepted Jesus as my Savior. I loved being a girl but because I was taller than all of my class (boys included), more muscular than all my girlfriends, wasn’t dainty, and didn’t have a huge interest in “girly” things, I felt very out of place and confused about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to be </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a girl. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What about your tween daughter? Is she a glitz-loving girly girl? How about a football-chasing tomboy? Both of these groups may be ridiculed by their peers and society, but we want to talk about why God thinks BOTH (as well as all the girls in between) are awesome! Whether she prefers to run around with dirt under her fingernails or she loves to hit the nail salon with you or friends, her preference matters to God. Whether she prefers to play with dinosaurs and trucks over dolls and tea sets, there is something God can use in those separate interests. Whether she loves to play dress up like Princess Anna or like Batman, God wants to use that imagination for His glory and honor. Whether she dreams of being a marine biologist, a mother, the president, or a librarian, God has something special and unique for her to do that no one else can do! </span>

In a recent focus group, 76% of moms said their tween daughters struggle to obey authority while 97% of those daughters admitted they struggle to obey.  Virtually all of our tween girls are struggling to prize an attitude of respect in our “here’s a blue ribbon for showing up” and “you totally deserve that pricey frappuccino” culture.  Don’t get us wrong, we think being a strong girl is awesome! So during our last <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girlgab.php">SKG Girl Gab Mother/Daughter Bible study</a>, we looked at the story of Abigail to learn how to be BOTH strong and humble. It's Girl Power God's Way!

Have your daughter open her Bible to 1 Samuel 25 and read verses 1-13, 18-20, and 23-28.

	<li><strong>1. Jesus is the <em>King</em> of <em>Kings</em> and the Lord of Lords!</strong> (Revelation 19:16)
Now what does this have to do with being a daughter of the King? Well everything, really! Jesus is THE King. He's not just <em>a </em>king or one of many kings, but THE King. He's the number one ruler!</li>

	<li><strong>2. We are God’s <em>children</em>. He predestined us for <em>adoption</em>. Since Jesus is the King of Kings, and we are His adopted daughters, that makes us <em>princesses</em>. </strong>(Romans 8:15-17 and Ephesians 1:4-5)
If you have A. admitted that you are a sinner, have B. believed that only Jesus can save you from your sin [because He lived a perfect life, died in your place to pay the penalty for your sin, and rose again on the third day], and have C. confessed that Jesus is the King and that you want to be in His family, guess what? You ARE a Princess, daughter of the real-live King! Yes, this is awesome! You are a daughter of the King! But there's a catch.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>3. I am not <em>my own</em>.</strong>  (1 Corinthians 6:19)</li>
	<li>Remember if you're a daughter of the King, you get to belong to THE King! So yes, you are a Princess but you are not the one on the throne. Jesus is and we submit our lives to His authority. And we submit to the authority that God has placed over us. This is hard one but if we can't submit to the authority over our lives, we won't submit to Jesus either. Jesus placed us in families so that we can learn how to live out Ephesians 5:21, which says 'submit to one out of reverence to Christ'. And He know this is super hard but He has promised to help us with this!</li>

<blockquote>MONTHLY CHALLENGE - This is not easy so PRACTICE living as if your life is not your own. Choose a slot of time in which you are usually free to do whatever you want (maybe right after school or when your homework is completed). Instead of using that time to focus on yourself, use it to meet a need of someone in your home. Here are a few options (or choose your own):
1. Offer to cook dinner one evening. Encourage your parents to spend the time they would have spent cooking and cleaning doing something that helps them relax.
2. Take your younger brother or sister outside for some play time. Let them pick the game and they play until you’re both worn out. For extra credit, allow a friend of your brother or sister’s hang out too.
3. Spend 30 minutes in prayer for someone in need. Don’t use this prayer time to make requests for yourself. Concentrate your prayer efforts on the needs of someone else.</blockquote>

With programs like Toddlers and Tiaras and reality shows where sass and diva-ness is applauded and laughed at, it's no wonder that many struggle with raising daughters who aren't brats. Now you may be thinking, 'nope! That's not my little girl!' If that's true, awesome, but let's ask you a question - does your daughter act like no one can tell her what to do? Like she's in charge of her own life?

If the answer is yes, you're not alone. In one of our recent focus groups, 76% of moms said their tween daughters struggle to obey authority while 97% of those daughters admitted they struggle to obey. <span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">Virtually all of our tween girls are struggling to prize an </span>attitude of respect in our “here’s a blue ribbon for showing up” and “you totally deserve that pricey frappuccino” culture. Don’t get us wrong, we think being a strong girl is awesome! In fact, throughout the Bible God repeatedly uses super strong ladies to do super important things. Let’s take a look at the biblical example of Abigail and learn how to do girl power God’s way with both strength and respect.

Welcome to 2016, moms! With so many social media dangers and apps like Snapchat and Instagram, it’s so hard to know when/if your child should even have a phone and if she does, where is the line? Ah the great debate and while we hear you, we think the debate should go beyond should my child have a cell phone or not. If you decide to not give your child a phone, great! But if you do (that’s wonderful!), have you set your daughter up so she knows how to handle the device in a mature and healthy way?

Your daughter had to be taught how to properly tie and wear her shoes, right? Well in the same way, she must be taught how to use electronic devices in a mature and healthy way. Children can’t do what they haven’t been taught to do, so during our last SKG Girl Gab Mother/Daughter Bible study, we went "Online with Eve" to learn 5 truths about self-control your daughter needs to know so she can handle electronics wisely.

Have your daughter open her Bible to Genesis 3 and read verses 1-13 and 20-21.
<ol>
	<li><strong>1. Everything God made is <em>good</em></strong>. (Genesis 1:31)</li>
	<li>The tree of knowledge of good and evil that Eve and her husband, Adam, ate from was good because God created it and <em>everything</em> God has created is good. Think about all the things that make up cell phones or tablets or television screens. God created the brains that developed the internet. He made the materials that make up cell phones. He made the air and sound waves upon which radio and television pictures travel to our electronic devices. The internet, media, and electronics <em>can be </em>used for good things and maybe the thing that is tempting you is actually a good thing, which leads us to #2.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>2. </strong><strong>Satan is a <em>liar</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:1; John 8:34)</li>
	<li>Depending on what version of the Bible you're reading, Genesis 3:1 may say Satan was "crafty" which means, Satan is untruthful and sneaky. John 8:34 names Satan as the 'Father of All Lies,' meaning all lies come from him. So Satan will take something is good and has a good purpose and lie to us about its purpose so that we are tempted to do bad things with it. Satan twisted what God said and made Eve think that God was withholding something good from her. In the same way, Satan's lies can make us feel like we will miss out on something or like we won't be considered cool if we follow God's way.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>3. </strong><strong>Eve had to make a decision to be <em>God-controlled</em> by being <em>self-controlled</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:4)</li>
	<li>Self-control is actually a fruit of the Spirit, meaning it comes from God. He gives us the ability to control ourselves so if we don't have God helping us, we can't have self-control. Eve had a decision to make - whether she was going to believe Satan, the liar, or believe God and use His help to control herself. We too have to decide whether we're going to let media and television control us or whether we're going to use God's help, His Spirit, to have control over us.</li>
	<li><strong>4. Giving into <em>temptation</em> always leads to a <em>situation</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:6-7)</li>
	<li>Temptation leads you to a place where instead of feeling good or comforted, you feel naked and ashamed like Eve did when God came to find her. But the good news is found in #5...</li>
	<li><strong>5. God will <em>comfort</em> you if you don’t keep <em>hiding</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:21)</li>
	<li>Adam and Eve had to come out and let God see them. Once they revealed themselves, God gave them fur coats (or garments of skins), which means He clothed them. He comforted them.</li>
</ol>
Girls and moms, we all face temptation, things that tease us into doing the wrong thing. But with God's help, we can all choose to be self-controlled. And when we mess up, when we give into temptation, we can also choose to come out of hiding. Daughters, if you're hiding something, if you've done something or looked at something you know you weren't supposed to, don't stay silent any longer. Come out! Tell God, tell your mom. They may give you consequences - which are really for your good -  but they will also give you comfort through their love and forgiveness.

Let's admit one thing: it's not unusual to want to be loved!

Every person on earth has a deep desire to be loved. While we girls may endure an especially pronounced craving for it, love is a basic need of humanity. Guys just don't tend to act as needy for us as we act for them. And that's where some of our woundedness begins. We think they can fix our hearts. They know they can't, so they get annoyed when we expect them to at least try.

Once during a difficult season of feeling unloved and craving violently for my husband to fix it, I cried out to God with the guttural pleading of the deeply wounded. In complete desperation, I began a journey of praying through my need, which led me to Proverbs 19:22, and I encourage you to start your own journey to true love with this same verse. It reads:
<blockquote>What a man desires is unfailing love;
better to be poor than a liar.
(Proverbs 19:22, NIV)</blockquote>
That verse was like a healing balm to my heart. It gave me permission to be love crazy! It said to me, "Dannah, let's just put it out there: everyone has a deep desire to be loved. Don't lie about it. Just say it like it is: I want to be loved!"

If you and your teen daughter have been to our Pure Freedom Teen Tour, you know all about our Love Feast. If you haven't, first - grab your teen girl (and any teen girls and their moms who you know) and come see us! Details are further down in this email. Second, let me explain the Love Feast. It's a ten day experience that we want your teen daughter to join...no guys, just God.

The salve for your daughter's deep craving will not be found in white-knuckling her way out of boy-craziness. It won't be found in legalistically "fasting from guys" without feeding her true need for love. It's not going to work for her to deny her deep and genuine desire. The best place for her to begin is to verbally spiritually express a deep truth: I need love!

You see, God alone holds the answer to our deep craving for love. He is our Source. Tell your daughter to give it a try. <strong>Let her be love crazy</strong>!

For your daughter to <a href="http://purefreedom.org/love-feast/">join our Love Feast</a>, she only needs to do two things.
She'll need to grab her copy of <em><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/get-lost-your-guide-to-finding-true-love">Get Lost</a></em>. If she doesn't have it, not to worry! We have a special <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/get-lost-book-t-shirt-gift-pack">February Love Feast Pack</a> just for her below.

She needs to <a href="http://purefreedom.org/love-feast/">register at this link</a>. Starting March 1, 2016 we'll keep in touch with her via email daily with direction and encouragement as she learns to feast on God's love.
We hope your girl will join us!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom, you send us emails all the time asking for advice. From questions about friends, siblings, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues with self-entitlement to boys and puberty, we’re happy we get to offer you biblically sound and practical help. We recently received the following email from an SKG mom and are wondering if this resonates with you: </span>
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend, our tween had a few girlfriends say over at our house - and they all stayed on their phones almost the entire time! Instead of simply playing games and engaging with each other, the entire night was documented with pictures and videos, all of which were immediately uploaded to Instagram. From then on, any dialogue was about whose picture or video received the most views and likes. Later, I overheard an Instagram video of a girl who, finding out about the get together online, was upset at not being invited to the party. I was totally speechless and taken by surprise! I mean, what ever happened to girls going to each other’s houses to chat, giggle, and play games?</span></i></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Whatever happened to that? Welcome to 2016, moms! With so many social media dangers and apps like Snapchat and Instagram, it's so hard to know when/if your child should even have a phone and if she does, where is the line? While we hear you, we think the debate should go beyond should my child have a cell phone or not. If you decide to not give your child a phone, great! But if you do (that's wonderful!), PLEASE make sure your instructions go beyond telling her how the functions work and when she can/can't use the phone.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Torres* family is an incredibly courageous group with deeply wounded hearts and the most basic of needs. The mother was widowed by the tragic suicide of her husband, whose body was discovered in their living room by his daughters [aged 16, 15, 13, 8, and 6]. To say that this left an emotional scar on their precious hearts is inaccurately miniaturized. This has set the family in a dark place of poverty and hopelessness. The children are in tears frequently as they face the daily hunger of poverty. This family is crying out for the most basic of needs – food, protection, love. (*Name has been changed)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This past fall, a very talented teen musician named Heather* started her first year as a drum major for the marching band. She was a fierce leader even before becoming drum major, standing out as the only girl on the drumline. She took full advantage of this position by befriending and inspiring other girls to get involved with music. Heather’s mom glowed with pride and supported her daughter by becoming very active with the other band parents. Her first year as a drum major should have been filled with joy, exciting challenges, and memory-makers, but these ‘should have been’s’ were confronted with a harsh reality early this year. Heather’s mom had already beaten breast cancer when Heather was just a baby, but tragically found out she had developed advanced throat cancer mere months before Heather stepped into her new role. Heather’s mom’s chemotherapy has kept her from watching her daughter march, and as the cancer ravages her body, the family is unsure of how much time she has left. They’re longing to make this year’s holiday season a memorable one. (*Names have been changed)</span>

On December 1, 2015 (#GivingTuesday), help us raise $10,000 <strong>and</strong> become one of 50 new Girl to Girl (G2G) members who will partner with us in ministry and help us reach more families like Heather’s with Jesus’ love.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica* and her 10 year old daughter, Rachel*, are an all-American military family and as such they have to be separated for long seasons of deployment and various military trainings. They have had to adjust and work at being flexible in ways that should never be asked of a mother and daughter. Thankfully, Rachel is blessed with loving family members who love to have her stay with them when her mother is away serving our country - but there is nothing quite like being cared for by your own mother. Unfortunately, Rachel has never met her father.  We want to send Rachel a #SKGPinkBox this Christmas to help her find a beautiful relationship with her Heavenly Father, and pursue His heart for purity and modesty. (*Names have been changed)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chloe* joined the surrounding tweens in laughter and music at a Secret Keeper Girl show just over a month ago.  While all of the the crazy fun and colorful balloons lifted her spirits, the glowing smile on her face faded as she lay in her hospital bed that night. Chloe is a beautiful 13 year old who lives at a hospital because she suffers from severe depression, anxiety, and extending physical ailments which have been complicated by an eating disorder. Looking on the outside one would never know the depth of Chloe’s distress, but on the inside her heart and soul are screaming in pain. Her father abandoned her and her mother when Chloe was just a baby. It’s an absence that has always been felt, but as Chloe ventures into her teenage years the lack of fatherly love and support is mighty. She struggles with hating herself for not being enough for her father to stay. Her mother does everything she can to support and provide for her, but steady employment has been hard to come by with her daughter in the hospital. Chloe’s mom has her own depth of physical and emotional pain to overcome, and she is doing her very best to be strong for her daughter. With the father’s lack of financial and emotional child support and their own minimal income, Chloe and her mother could use a practical gift of love. (*Names have been changed)</span>

The <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php" target="_blank">Secret Keeper Girl to Girl</a> fund exists to be able to hear a need and respond to it on the spot! Through your Girl to Girl donations, a myriad of cries from families and children have been heart and met. Here is a special story that is close to our hearts…

In June 2015, <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php" target="_blank">Secret Keeper Girl to Girl (G2G)</a> provided funding for life-saving medical treatment and transportation for a little boy in Haiti named Pierre. Without access to proper medical treatment, Pierre developed a life threatening medical condition that doctors are currently working to fully diagnose. His local doctors lacked access to necessary medical equipment and nutritional formulas for him but your generosity helped to deliver him into safe hands. He is still fighting malnourishment, dehydration, partial paralysis and uncontrollable movements of some limbs among other things but his condition is improving with proper medical attention and proper nutrition, and we are praising the Lord for his continued improvement.
<blockquote>
<h3>"Thanks to you, Dannah, and your entire team. You’re buying us time, and you’re buying his momma hope."
– Pastor who is facilitating Pierre’s treatment in Haiti</h3>
</blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year a very special <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> (G2G) partner named Julie inspired our hearts and did something that we will never forget.  As the single mother of a beautiful tween she realized the immense blessings God had bestowed upon her and decided to BE a blessing. She reached out to the <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> family on behalf of a single mom who had escaped an abusive relationship with her tween and was now living with her until she could get back on her feet. One of the biggest hurdles Julie faced was saving a storage facility that held all of her houseguest's belongings (school pictures, Christmas stockings, and priceless memories) that was set to be auctioned off. Julie contacted us, and we were able to use donations from the <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> fund to rescue everything they had just two weeks before auction! We were able to make Christmas morning very special for these two families as we even got to surprise them with checks and special presents. Julie’s reaction will fill your heart with joy.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you all for the amazing Christmas blessings!...Thank you for the amazing way you minister to our hearts and the hearts of our daughters, for the way you show Jesus’ love in practical ways…[you have] changed our lives... I still haven’t found the right words to express the love and gratitude we are feeling. For some people this check would be a nice bonus. For us, it was a</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>game changer</strong>.”</span></i></h3>
</blockquote>
Give a gift that could change things tremendously for a family in need this Christmas. On #GivingTuesday this <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2009456685"><span class="aQJ">December 1</span></span>, we want to raise $10,000 and get 50 new Girl to Girl (G2G) members who will partner with us in ministry and help us reach more families with Jesus’ love.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer 2015 was a weird one for me. It was filled with lessons and growth which led to very frustrating freedom. Sounds like an oxymoron, right? Well, let me explain - for the first time in my life, I actually enjoyed being in my own skin this past summer and it was awesome! I've had had a long, long journey (which I am still on) in learning to love how I was fashioned and formed by God. I have had to learn to accept that I have a naturally bigger framework and curves in what I think are peculiar places. One of my biggest insecurities comes from having grown so quickly when I was a child. When I was born, doctors told my parents I would be in the 90th percentile of height, weight, and growth for kids my age. The result of growing too fast for my skin? Stretch marks - and I have always <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hated</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them! I never wore anything that would show my skin, including shirts with sleeves higher than your typical t-shirt sleeve length because of my marks. But it was hard to be a part of our campaign be around our newest books <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><i>It’s Great to Be A Girl</i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/new-stuff/products/raising-body-confident-daughters"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising Body Confident Daughters</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” without hearing The Spirit speaking to my heart about my body insecurities. The Lord worked on my heart and eyes and helped me to start seeing what He saw in me, and helped </span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">me become comfortable with all the things that make me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including my stretch marks.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With my new found comfortableness in ‘this is me, my body, and I love it’ and my always increasing confidence thanks to working out (oh yeah, endorphins!), I was ready to venture into new fashion territory… (read as "things that showed off just a little bit of skin"). Only I couldn’t in good conscience. Freedom immediately followed by frustration! </span></span></span></span>

<iframe class="giphy-embed" src="//giphy.com/embed/93rI3szziYMYo" width="248" height="248" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand I knew God was healing my view of myself. He was giving me confidence. So why couldn’t I wear what I wanted to wear? If I’m proud of my body now and thankful for what He’s done in it and with it, what’s the big deal with wearing certain things?’ Can you relate? Frustrating freedom is what I felt and to be honest, The Spirit and I battled with this for a few weeks as both my flesh and my spirit were in it to win it. Have you ever been here? What would you do? What have you done?
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the Lord made it very simple. Not easy but simple. I have an immediate authority over me in the form of my job and bosses. How could I wear something that I get on stage and encourage girls every single night <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to wear. God told me this: I can’t rebel against the authority that He’s placed over my life without rebelling against Him. It just doesn’t work that way. We can’t pick and choose the ways in which we </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obey God. Either we obey fully or we don’t at all.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if I didn’t work for Secret Keeper Girl? What if the school doesn’t have a dress code? What if friends and family around you are shouting ‘there is freedom in Christ!’? Well, yeah there most definitely is. But God took things a bit further for me and I remembered a concept that Secret Keeper Girl co-creator Dannah Gresh discussed in our </span><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mother/Daughter ‘Moonwalking’ Date</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. [BTW: Moms, truth is truth and applicable for us no matter what our age or situation. I don’t even have kids, yet God is always teaching me something from the resources we make available for you and your daughters. I hope </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are taking advantage.] The moonwalking date was not a contest to see who could do the best <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/michael-jackson-moonwalk-Dk1eDBR6mhakE">Michael Jackson impersonation</a> (which would be awesome) </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>but rather about ‘glory'. <strong>Who or what am I glorifying when I wear or <i>don’t</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> wear certain things?</strong> This was a hard question to swallow and it was kind of tricky for my mind to wrap itself around because I just wanted to celebrate and bask in my confidence and how great I was feeling as I took care of the body GOD had blessed me with! </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like something a good Christian girl would think and want to do, right? </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh my friends, so many of us get tripped up in this! Being good for goodness sake or so others will think you are a good Christian means nothing to the Lord. Being good, yeah it looks great on the outside - we say the right things, wear the right things, go to the right places. But may The Spirit always remind us that God is not interested in goodness. His heart's desire is that we be holy. Holiness, because it is about the heart and a person's motivations, always takes things a bit further. Pursuing His holiness means acting solely in the interest of only one person - Jesus Christ. Period. See, on the surface it sounded like I wanted to give God a shout-out as I chose certain clothes, but beneath, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted to be seen. I wanted to show off </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my</span></i></span><i> </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard work. I wanted to show how much </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had grown. There was a deeper lesson for me to learn and God wanted me not only to understand that lesson but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">live and act differently</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a result.</span> <strong>God does things in and through my body <i>not</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> for me but for Him</strong>. Always! He’s concerned about His glory and His name. And the only way to truly please Him is to get on board with His agenda. It’s not about us. Even down to what we do or even do not wear - it’s never about us. And let me tell you, any frustration that comes along with living with His glory in mind (because it <em>does</em> come!) is <strong>totally</strong> worth the gifts of joy, freedom, and intimacy with Him He gives as blessings for obeying Him. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the next time your daughter wants to wear something or do something, even if the reasoning seems good, ask the Holy Spirit to take your mind and heart deeper into holiness. Ask your daughter if what she is thinking about wearing is going to show off God or herself? We believe that is God’s heart concerning modesty and we desire to follow His line of thinking. Also remember that it’s important to pursue complete holiness in the motivations of our hearts. What are your (or your daughter’s) motivations for <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wearing certain things? Is it so God will be honored or so you’ll be seen as a "good Christian girl (or woman)"? You see, it goes both ways and the issue is always where is your heart because either you’re for God’s glory or against it. It’s plain and simple - not easy, but simple. </span></span>
<h4>Share below - Have you ever been frustrated with being modest? How did you handle it?</h4>

A healed and whole mom is equipped to raise pure girls. Conversely, a mom who is unhealed and unwhole will struggled to mentor her girls. We want you moms to walk in spiritual wellness and healing so you can be a truly amazing mother but also so you can be a phenomenal and whole woman of God! That woman who is brimming with spiritual power and life is the type of woman Jesus died to give you freedom to be!

Let's remind you of the truths we learned <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/featured/questions-you-never-want-your-daughter-to-ask/">last week</a>.
<blockquote>Psalm 25:14 (KJV) reads “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will shew them His covenant.</blockquote>
The secret of the Lord are “the people of God who are friends." The Hebrew language describes these people as a <strong>tight-knit group of intimate friends among whom weaknesses, strengths, successes, and failures are shared. Within this circle sins are confessed an<img class="  wp-image-6213 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/o-2-WOMEN-FRIEND-TALKING-facebook-300x150.jpg" alt="o-2-WOMEN-FRIEND-TALKING-facebook" width="370" height="185" />d forgiven</strong>. It's a place where masks of perfection are removed and there is no fear of telling our stories because everyone is <strong>truly known</strong>. <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">The Secret of The Lord</a> is all about living in intimate and open community with fellow believers as you are honest about your dreams, failures, past sins, and goals. We invite start your journey today! Below you'll find the first 3 steps to take toward your spiritual healing as you enter into the secret of the Lord.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step One: Pray</span>
Ask the Lord to help you identity the person you should ask to join you in the secret of the Lord. Often our minds rush to friends or obvious relationships. While the whole idea behind the secret of the Lord is having a <i>group</i> of people who walk in spiritual intimacy with you, it’s often wise to first connect to someone who can mentor you for a while before you begin to open up to peers. God may have chosen someone for you who is not in your immediate circle of influence or who isn’t an obvious match. It may be someone you never imagined so just sit quietly and ask the Lord to give you some names to consider.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Two: Select</span>
Choose someone you know and see often. We really want you to find at least one ongoing relationship where you can grow in spiritual intimacy. That’s not going to happen if you confess to someone who you don’t see all the time. Sometimes confessing to someone you’ll never see again helps you build confidence but that’s not going to help you enter into the secret of the Lord. If you select someone who doesn’t run in your circle, be ready to reconfigure your life to create frequent contact. Select someone who is an older, wiser advisor who will have some perspective that you don’t yet have. Unless you are confessing to your husband, the person you choose should be a woman.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Three: Renounce</span>
Speak out against your past mistakes and sin in the presence of your friend. Once you’ve figured out who to talk to, ask her to set aside some private time to help you talk through some issues and simply let it spill out. After you have spent some time sharing and hearing her advice, be sure to apply the truth of 2 Corinthians 4:2, which says, “We have to <i>renounce</i> secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyman’s conscience in the sight of God.”

The Greek word for the word <i>renounce</i> is <i>apeipon</i>, which means “to speak out against.” So sit down with your new confidant - your first taste of the secret of the Lord - and speak out! Pray out loud in power and authority. Confless. Claim healing. Renounce!

You can’t even imagine how good it’s gonna feel! Ladies, this is the most painful part of entering into the secret of the Lord, but don’t miss it! Adventure and more importantly freedom awaits! A great aid to going through this journey is to go through it with a friend. We don’t want you to let the fear of going through this alone stop you. So we have a <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">BOGO deal</a>, buy one book for yourself, get one for a friend for FREE!! Grab her by the hand and you take these steps toward spiritual healing and abundant living together, in Jesus’ name!

<p style="text-align: left;">Moms, the heart and desires you have for your children are known. We hear you. We see you. The resources we provide are based off of those prayers you pray during the middle of the night as you think about your babies. During those prayers, does your mind ever travel to a deeply hurtful and dark place; a place where you pray to God your daughter never, ever goes near. Are there secrets in your past? Are there things about your life that you pray your children never ask you about. Guess what? You're not alone. We have those places too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Unless we sense that we belong to each other with masks off, the vibrant church of today will become the powerless church of tomorrow.” Larry Crabb</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did something tug in your heart as you read over the word "masks"? That mask you have on tries to convince you that you look as good and are as happy as everyone else but truthfully, you feel as if you're dying on the inside. You’re feeling so lonely and broken and feel totally unknown and the enemy has caused you to believe these lies. Your mask is an isolating barrier that leads to a lack of spiritual power in your life.</p>
Moms, listen. Spiritual power is directly related to your own spiritual health. A physically sick person has a hard time getting up and helping other people, right? Well, the same is true of spiritually sick or weak person. But as you heal, the better you can lead and teach your own children. Having the Holy Spirit alive and active in your life is imperative as you train your children up in God’s way. He’s vital in transforming you into woman, wife, mother that is after His heart.

John 10:10 says that Jesus came that we may <i>have life and have it to the full</i>. <b>Do you know this abundant life? </b>What’s your spiritual pulse like? Are you living in the great adventure and miracles of God? Or are you closer to living in a spiritual coma? Do you long for something more. . . something deeper?

The psalmist King David wrote a powerful prescription for the masked perfection and powerlessness believers are experiencing today.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 25:14 (KJV) reads “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will shew them His covenant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">In it’s most literal translation, the secret of the Lord would be “the people of God who are friends.” It’s us. It’s you. And the Hebrew language describes these people as a <strong>tight-knit group of intimate friends among whom weaknesses, strengths, successes, and failures are shared. Within this circle sins are confessed and forgiven</strong>. Our masks of perfection are removed and there is no fear of telling our stories. We are truly known. The secret of the Lord is the intimate friendship that exists between believers.</p>
We want you to have the power of the secret of the Lord unleashed in your life. It’s real! It’s life-changing! It’s reviving and it’s the door to spiritual power! We encourage you to start practicing the secret of the Lord intimacy today!! First give that tug you feel in your heart to Jesus, right now. Then ask Him to give you courage to call up your best friend and ask her to join you in reading through <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo"><em>The Secret of The Lord</em></a>! There is a <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">BOGO deal</a> happening : buy a book for yourself, get a book for your friend for FREE [coupon code: JULYSECRET]!!!

This is the big one, mom! The conversation everyone wants a book to help with.

Basically all Christian psychologists and family experts out there all agree that the big <strong>sex</strong> talk needs to take place much earlier than we, as parents, are generally comfortable having it. What happens if you wait? Jimmy Hester, founder of True Love Waits and editor of the biblically based Christian Sex Education says that  “By ten or eleven years, many children who have not received adequate instructions about the facts of sexuality become disturbed and worry about what is real. They usually have heard bits and pieces of facts from peers.” [Jimmy Hester, ed Christian Sex Education (Lifeway, Nashville; 1995), 42.] Moms, you’ve got to begin to have the conversation about sexuality when your daughter is between the ages of six and ten. This devo will help you initiate this conversation.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Read John 16: 21. Does having a baby hurt? (Answer: Yes. It’s a lot of work for a body to do.) Does a mother remember the pain? (Answer: No. She forgets it and only remembers the joy. You might explain how this has been lived out in your own life.)</li>
	<li>2. How are you feeling about getting your period in the next few years?  (Answers will vary. Help her focus on the positive gift of her cycle.)</li>
	<li>3. Do you have any more questions about how your body creates life? (This is important whether you have or have not already had the sex talk. It may be the prompt she needs to ask what she’s really thinking. If you have had the talk, it may make her feel comfortable asking questions about it. You want to be the authority on all things related to gender and sex so make sure she knows she can ask anything at any time.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Chocolate Date Location Ideas</b>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Factory
</span>Visit a small chocolate boutique or a large chocolate factory and learn about chocolate. Be sure to enjoy taste-testing. Take a bag home to share with dad.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Fondue at a Restaurant
</span>Restaurants like The Melting Pot have killer fondue. Just make sure to make a reservation as it you can wait for pro-longed periods of time if you do not.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Campfire
</span>If the weather is nice, you could consider lighting up a camp fire and making S’mores for this date. Here’s my tip for the world’s best S’more. Find a clean rock and place it near the heat of the fire. Put your graham cracker and chocolate on the rock so the chocolate warms and softens while you are roasting your marshmallow. Be careful it doesn’t turn to liquid chocolate. Yummmm!

As you're bringing up your tween, you're probably starting to notice something - 'hygiene isn’t easy to talk about or teach biblically, simply because there’s not a lot about practical cleansing in the Bible. (There’s much more on ritual cleansing.) But, one thing stands true: your body is a holy temple for the living God of our the universe. Your daughter needs to know this. Her body is a temple of the living God—His dwelling place. And if God is living in [her] body, then it should be cared for better than the Taj Mahal.' So without further ado, here's devo #4 : a "body boosting" bubble bath!

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>A bubble bath

<i>Subject:</i> Hygiene

<i>Setting Options:</i> a Jacuzzi tub at a hotel, grandmas or your own house

<i>Materials You’ll Need:</i>

• Reservations at a hotel, or resort, or grandmas. You might also just plan to do this at your own home.

•A “body boost” gift bag or basket full of hygiene products such as deodorant, shampoo, a razor, and body wash.

<ol>
	<li>1. Read I Corinthians 3:16,17. What does it call your body? (Answer: A temple.) A temple is a place where God lives, so that means God’s Spirit is living in you. How does that make you feel? (Answers will vary.)</li>
	<li>2. Does God’s Spirit live in everyone? (Answer: No. He lives in those who have asked Christ to be the Lord of their life. If you or your daughter have not made this decision scroll down to find the 'The A, B, C’s of Becoming A Christian'.)</li>
	<li>3. If God is living in us, what does that say about how we should care for our bodies? (Answers will vary: we should clean them, provide nutrition, avoid putting harmful substances in them, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Body Boost Gift Basket
</b>Create a fun basket for your daughter that includes items she’ll use in her bubble bath, but also on a regular basis from this day forward. Be sure to include what she’s ready for, but not things she doesn’t yet need. For example, a nine year old may not need acne medication just yet. Hold off on that and maybe just buy her a simple facial cleanser.

<b>The A, B, C’s of Becoming a Christian</b>

Lots of people say they are Christians, but I am fairly convinced that many of them are not. What a sad thing to think that going to church, being good, or calling yourself a Christian would be your ticket to heaven all the while never having actually chosen to follow Jesus Christ in obedience. Jesus himself said he was the only way to heaven. John 14:6 reads: “Jesus said ..., “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Becoming a Christian is not difficult, but many are confused or distracted by things and actions that do not make them any more a Christian than walking on all fours makes me a dog!

<b>A—Admit you are a sinner.</b> A person must start with the confession that she has sinned. She must be both sorry for her sin and willing to stop. It doesn’t matter if it is fighting with your siblings, cheating on a test or—moms—cheating on your taxes or fighting with your siblings! Sin separates us from God. Because he is so perfect and holy, we cannot be in the presence of uncleansed sin. Romans 3:23 says “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” There’s that word again—glory. We cannot reflect God’s image if there is sin in us. And this verse say’s we’re all guilty.

<b><i>If you know you have sinned, pause to verbally confess your sin to Him right now.</i></b>

<b>B—Believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that his death on the cross was payment for all your sins.</b> You may be familiar with John 3:16. That beloved, worn out but never weary Bible verse reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” What kind of love is that? That God would sacrifice his only son so that we can live with him. He so wants you to be a Christian because he loves you.

<b><i>If you believe Jesus is God’s son, pause to verbally say that to him out loud.</i></b>

<b>C—Confess your faith in Jesus out loud and to others.</b> Romans 10:9,10 says that “if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Salvation requires your mouth! You must tell both God and others that Jesus is the Lord of your life.

<b><i>If you want Jesus to be the Lord of your life, begin by pausing to ask him verbally right now. Then, pick up the phone and tell someone! Goodness, hop onto Facebook and tell me. I’d so love to know that you prayed this prayer and have become my sister in Jesus today. Welcome to the family!</i></b>

Before we get started, let's review really quickly!

<b>- <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf">Date #1</a> : Your daughter’s primary purpose is to glorify God. (I Corinthians 6:20)
</b><b>- Date #2 : Your daughter’s primary practice, then, must be to look like him and we do that best in the context of distinctive maleness or femaleness. (Genesis 1:26,27)
</b><b>- Date #3 - Your daughter’s body, therefore, must be living sacrifices to God. (Romans 12:1,2)</b>

Ultimately, God gets to choose how we live out the practice of glorifying him and being faithful to glorify God in our bodies as girls and women requires sacrifice. This is a truth that you need to infuse this truth in to your daughter at a young age. It is God who gets to decide how we work, live, give, spend, marry, and worship. Not ourselves. Because what your daughter does now will affect her future, teach her now that sacrifice is critical and she’ll live it out as you and I have learned to do.

Everyone’s career requires sacrifice. Perhaps none more than that of a mom! But your girl probably sees that everyday, so let’s get her into the shoes of someone with a different career that would interest her.

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>Career Day

<i>Subject:</i> Your body should be a living sacrifice

<i>Setting Options</i>: The office of someone whose career interests your daughter (A vet’s office, a horse barn, a church children’s department, a fireman’s truck, an athlete’s gym, etc.)

<i>Materials You’ll Need at Your Destination: </i>

•An appointment with a person whose career would be of interest to your daughter
•A notepad with questions written in it (see below)
•<a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It's Great to Be a Girl</em></a> book by Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel.

There are two goals during the challenge. The first, is to introduce your daughter to an exciting career that may interest her in the future. The second (but more important) purpose is to introduce her to the act of sacrificing her body in obedience to God’s calling on her life.

Schedule an appointment for her to interview someone whose career would be of interest to her. After she’s had a nice tour of the work area, helped to sell a car, saddle a horse, or paint a wall—let her sit down to interview the person she’s shadowing. You will have already written these questions into a notebook so she can ask them and take notes.
<ol>
	<li>1. What is your favorite thing about your career?</li>
	<li>2. What is the least favorite thing about your career?</li>
	<li>3. How do you prepare or care for your body for this field of work?</li>
	<li>4. What sacrifices have you needed to make in the past for this career?</li>
	<li>5. What sacrifices do you continue to make for this career?</li>
</ol>
For the best results use <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body">It’s Great To Be A Girl</a>.</i> Do Meditation #8 together.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Discuss the interview focusing on the way the person sacrificed in the past and even now. (Answers will vary, but in my own career/ministry calling sacrifices include deadlines that force me to work on weekends or holidays, getting up as early as 3:00am to catch flights to speak somewhere, and being willing to go away from home for long periods of time to fulfill God’s call. I have to take care of my body by exercising or using a computer strains my neck. I also have to eat right or I don’t have the energy I need to make the sacrifices of getting up early and travelling. Taking care of my body is part of the sacrifice because I don’t like to exercise and control my eating but I know that I must to be healthy.)</li>
	<li>2. Read Romans 12:1,2. What does it mean to be a “living sacrifice?” (Answer: It means to give things up like sleep, free time, or hobbies so you can be disciplined and obedient.)</li>
	<li>3. How can you—as a tween girl—practice being a “living sacrifice” today so that you can be obedient to God in the career he calls you to? (Answers will vary but may include: helping you wash the dishes when you ask me, keeping my room clean so I can find things, finishing my homework before I watch TV, and getting up early enough to take care of my body—brushing my teeth, brushing my hair, taking a bath if I need it— before school.)</li>
	<li>4. MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION: Do you know what my career is? (Answer may be “mom” or  she may answer referring to a career you have outside the home. Either way, take this time to tell her that your career as a wife and mom is the most important thing that you do. That you love it more than any other career you’ve ever had and you’d happily be “wife” and “mom” at the expense of all the other careers in the world. Explain to her sacrifices you have made for this. Infuse her with passion for the greatest career in the world: mom.)</li>

In <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf">Devo #1</a>, you learned that the purpose of your body, of your daughter's body is to glorify God.

The next conversation to have with your daughter sits solidly on the truth that her primary purpose is to glorify God. Since that means she must make him known and visible, her primary practice will be to look like Him. Have fun on this 'Girls Night Out'!

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>Girl’s Night Out

<i>Key Verse: </i>Genesis 1:27

<i>Key Thought: </i>God made girls to reflect his image.

<i>Suggested Challenge Setting: </i>A fun place to eat out like a tea house or sports club. Use your daughter’s personality to pick the kind of place where you’ll host your girl’s night out.

<i>Recommendation:</i> Do this with a group of women. Ideally, women and their daughters who are using this book. Since each woman will be different in her expression of femininity, your daughter will be able to avoid getting stuck in stereotypes while still embracing her role as a woman.

<i>Materials You’ll Need at Your Destination</i>:

• Each adult or young adult woman attending should bring a photo (pulled from a magazine or taken by herself) that represents what it means to be a woman and why she loves it. (Ideas: This can be a picture of a tom boy playing softball and the woman who shares it can say that she loves being a woman who gets to play sports. Or it can be a picture of a woman with a baby and the woman who shares it can say she loves that women get to give birth and care for babies. You get the idea. Let it reflect the woman. The photos will be as diverse as your guest list.)

• <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It's Great to Be a Girl</em></a> book by Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel.

Select your destination, and invite your guests. Make sure you tell them to bring a photo that is reflective of their style of womanhood.

Once you are at the restaurant, you have one specific task, and it’s very easy: each woman will share her thoughts on womanhood by presenting the pre-selected photo to your daughter (or to the entire group if you are doing it as a small group). (More ideas: This can be a picture of a little girl playing dress up and the woman who shares it can say that she still loves it when she gets to dress up and express her beauty. Or it can be a picture of a woman working and the woman who shares it can say how she loves that God invites women to work hard.) Each photo can be presented to your daughter after it is explained.

You’ll wrap up this sharing time by presenting your own photo and the conversational teaching in this chapter.

Have your conversation at dinner after the meal is cleaned up or during dessert as a group. If you are using <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><i>It’s Great To Be A Girl</i></a>, do Meditation #2 together or assign it as homework.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Read Genesis 1:27 and talk about the word God uses to describe maleness and femaleness. (Answer: image or statue.) What does it mean that we are the image or statue of God? (Answer: Because he wants others to see him and so we must look like him in some way.)</li>
	<li>2. List some ways that boys and girls are very different. (Answer: Body parts, physical strength, interests, etc.) Review why God would have us be so very different, but still be capable of using us to look like him? (Answer: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are distinctively different and yet unified in to one. Since man and woman are different, but can become united in marriage we are a picture of God.)</li>
	<li>3. Read Ephesians 5:31,32. Talk about how maleness and femaleness comes together to be one. (Answer: Marriage.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Budget Cruncher: </b><i>A Girl’s Night Out at someone’s home can be a less expensive way to facilitate this conversation and every bit as fun. Each woman can bring one dish to share. You and your daughter should either make your food together before you go or make separate dishes. Let her be a part of the food fun! Here are some themes that could make food prep really fun as well as a few recipes. </i>

<strong>Lemon Moon Cookies</strong>

1 box lemon cake mix

2 cups Cool Whip topping

1 egg, beaten

2 T. lemon juice

Mix all of the above ingredients together. The mixture will be like a sticky pizza dough though not stretchy. Take a teaspoon full of batter and drop it into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Then, put the sugar dipped drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 11 minutes. Let cool before letting them melt in your mouth!

Have you noticed it? One minute she's as happy as a lark, and in a matter of seconds she can become enraged with anger or defeated in tears with no explanation at all. Nothing welcomes a tween to puberty quite like <em>mood swings</em>. Before you get frustrated, remember what it was like, Mom. You were there once too.

Hormones. They can make girls feel as though they are riding an emotional roller coaster through puberty. (Others living with a moody tween might find themselves clinging to the roller coaster for dear life!) Your daughter will either learn to control her emotions and feelings, or she will become controlled by them.

In addition to praying for extra grace and patience with your daughter, here are some tips for communicating with and encouraging your moody girl:

<strong>1. You have a choice</strong>. Remind your daughter God not only equipped her body with hormones, he equipped her spirit with self-control. God-given and more powerful than any hormone, self-control is a choice she must make. (Galatians 5:22-23a) Place the ball in her court and remind her that she can choose to respond to her emotions by exercising God's gift of self-control.

<strong>2. Take a moment.</strong> Encourage her to live by truth - she knows God desires us to be loving, respectful and kind to one another. When the mood swing sweeps her off her feet, have her take a moment before she reacts/responds to the situation that has pushed her button. Maybe it's a few deep breaths and counting to ten, going for walk or run, calmly going to her room to cool off and even have a good cry. Honor her need for space and privacy and encourage her to take it if and when she needs space. Mom, use this time to hit your knees in prayer for your girl. Fight for her and ask God for a special does of wisdom, discernment and patience.

<strong>3. Process and pray. </strong>No one can handle her emotions like God can. Rather than exploding on a parent, sibling or friend, have your daughter express her frustrations to God. Whether she's angry, sad, lonely, frustrated, defeated or just plain grumpy, help her find ways to communicate her emotions to the Lord. Maybe it's journaling, listening to worship music, drawing, or going on a hike and speaking out loud to him. He is big enough - he can handle her moods without taking offense.

<strong>4.</strong> <strong>Right the wrong. </strong>When a mood swing strikes, typically girls respond with hurtful words. Proverbs 12:18 says "The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing." If in her moodiness she has lashed out, show her how to make right the pain she may have caused another; support her as she exercises humility and takes responsibility for her actions.

<strong>5.</strong> <strong>Focus on others</strong>. In the midst of a mood swing, our focus is usually on ourself; how we feel, how we were wronged, how we think things should be… There's no better way to dispel a mood swing than by focusing on someone else. Establish a project she can return to when she's feeling a little hot-headed. Maybe she would enjoy crafting fleece blankets for the local animal shelter, writing notes of encouragement to the community police officers &amp; firemen, baking goodies for the nurses at the hospital or making photo collages for friends. By choosing to focus on others, she takes quick control of her heart, mind and emotions and operates with Jesus' servant heart.

<strong>6.</strong> <strong>You need to respect her.</strong> Yes, mom. Respect her. She doesn't understand her mood swings any more than you do at the moment. If you desire your tween to act respectfully toward you, you need to extend the same respect to her. Don't fly off the handle or resort to yelling (or participating in the tantrum with her). Your girl's body is changing and her brain is undergoing serious re-wiring; either of which can make her extremely volatile at times. By no means should you tolerate her tantrum; give her time to pull herself together before you discuss the situation. Ask if she wants you to stay or be alone while she calms down. When she's ready to talk, listen - listen deeply to what she has to say. Even if you disagree with her position, beliefs or current struggle, seek to find a happy middle. Acknowledge your girl's perspective. Hug her - hold her if she'll let you - and express to her how much she is loved. Pray with her about the situation that has upset her and ask that God teach her how to exercise self-control. Let her know that you've been in her shoes before. Remember what it was like for you… draw that grace from your toes if you need to!

Parenting through the tween years can make you feel like you're the one swinging off your rocker! Avoid the temptation to steer clear of your moody tween. This is when she needs your love, affirmation and acceptance the most.

Most little girls become interested in makeup after witnessing her mother put it on many times. It’s normal for girls to want to be and look like their mommies. If you’ve ever wondered why your daughter wants to help you as you clean the house, cook, or fold laundry - here’s your answer: she wants to emulate you! She looks up to you and admires you. She wants to be like you.

Usually her desire to wear makeup is no different. But as your daughter gets older, her reasons for wanting to dabble in makeup will probably expand as she encounters other girls her age. Unfortunately, there is no ‘correct’ age at which your daughter should start wearing makeup. For instance, Dannah began wearing light foundation in seventh grade but I (Charmaine) didn’t start wearing makeup until I was in college. Every girl and every face is different.

We think that instead of asking ‘when can I start wearing makeup?’ the question should be ‘what is your motivation’ for wearing makeup? In <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It’s Great To Be A Girl</em></a>, authors Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel outline three reasons why your daughter may want to wear makeup and what they think of them. We encourage you to go over this part with your daughters.

<strong>Wearing Makeup to Cover-up
</strong> “Lots of people wear makeup to cover up scars, acne, or birthmarks.” This is the whole reason why concealer or coverup exists, but its important to not overuse those products. If you do, not only can this have you looking like a clown, it could also clog your pores which could lead to more zits. Dannah and Suzy remind us that “the Bible says everything should be done in moderation and that can certainly apply to makeup!”

<strong>Wearing Makeup for Beauty
</strong> ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’ We’ve all heard that famous saying and we think it definitely applies here. “Everyone has her own definition of what is pleasing to look at. There is no true false standard when it comes to beauty. So does makeup make a girl look more beautiful? That would depend on those who are looking at the girl.” Besides, most people tend to think that too much makeup takes away from a person’s natural beauty.

<strong>Wearing Makeup to Look Older
</strong> A lot of times, girls start wearing makeup at young ages because they want to look more mature. You know what, that’s kind of just like telling a lie, right? We think so because “lies are anything we say or fail to say - anything we do or fail to do - that causes others to have an impression that is not true.” When you wear makeup to make yourself look like something that you’re not, you’re lying. Girls, we encourage you to enjoy being you, looking like you, and being young. It’s a beautiful and fun time of life!

Mom, when you see that your daughter’s motivation to wear makeup is pure, not for beauty or not to look older, take notice. When you see that your girl understands that her inner beauty is more important than her outer beauty so she isn't afraid to leave the house with an uncovered blemish, she just might be ready for you to take her to the nearest Sephora or Ulta for some fun! But ultimately, the answer of when should my daughter start wearing makeup is answered by “when Mom and Dad say it’s okay” - plain and simple.

<em>Mother/Daughter Challenge: spend more time beautifying your soul than you do beautifying your face. Example - if you spend 5 minutes in the mirror getting ready (with or without makeup), spend at least 6 minutes with Jesus that day. Simple as that! Try it for a week and notice where the greatest change takes place - your face or your heart. </em>

Looks are exorbitantly important in our world today. Our society is obsessed! Too often, it’s not the soul, heart, or character of a person that determines who or what they are. “Everything is about how [people] look and who is beautiful,” which is ironic because most of the beauty we see on television, billboards and in movies has been vastly altered through the power of makeup and magic of Photoshop. It’s fake. Unattainable. Yet it often tempts a lot of us to be unhappy with our natural and God-given beauty. Why is that?

In Dannah Gresh’s latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Body-Confident-Daughters-Conversations-Tween/dp/0736960058"><i>Raising Body-Confident Daughters</i></a>, she explains that “body consciousness is the state of being constantly aware of the body - either others or your own, but mostly your own.” A simple look at your daughter’s actions and priorities can tell you if she is currently body conscious or at risk of becoming so.

Does she have an obsession with clothing and make-up?
Is she constantly noticing the appearance of others or herself?
Does she seem to have body shame?
Does she sexualize herself or others?
Can she walk past a mirror without checking herself out?

If you daughter suffers from body-consciousness, she will most likely fall prey to being unsatisfied with how her Creator made her and try to achieve beauty in unrealistic and sometimes dangerous ways. If your daughter is body-conscious, she has a greater chance of having low self esteem, depression, and making an early sexual debut. Body-<b>confidence</b> is what we want to help your daughter (and you) achieve!

“Body-confidence is the state of knowing your body’s purpose and being able to depend on it to do what God designed it to do without making too much or too little of it.” On a pendulum, it is located somewhere in the middle of caring enough but not too much. How can this delicate balance be achieved? This may surprise you, but teaching your daughter to confidently care about her body in a godly way doesn’t even start with a focus on her body! It starts with an  “[emphasis on] the care of her spirit and [teaching] her to press in to godliness.” The road to body confidence starts with being more concerned with the spirit than the body.

The body is good. Beautiful. Each one is unique and was skillfully created to display the glory of God! But unless the spirit is surrendered to the control of the Holy Spirit, the body will not accomplish its glorious purpose. God, as your daughter’s Master Designer, is the best voice she can listen to on how to care about her body and appearance in a balanced and honorable way.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Job Qualifications</span></strong>
SKG interns are an important part of our team, therefore they need to have the ability to work and communicate well with other people.

Body image is something nearly every woman on the face of God's beautiful earth has struggled with at one time or another. Can't you relate, Mom?

When I take an honest look and give myself an honest listen, I am confronted with my own ability to harm my daughters. They are listening to you and I.

Our daughters listen when we look in the mirror and complain about our hair and wrinkles. They listen when we say we are fat and ugly. They hear us put ourselves down. They hear us compare our bodies and wardrobes to that of <em>Brittany's</em> mom.

Studies have been done to confirm that what a mom says about her own body becomes a consuming thought in her daughter's mind about <em>her own</em> body. The result? One magazine reported that 30% of ten-year-olds are worried about their body image.

Before you can talk to your daughter about having a healthy body image, you must have one! As women we have been made in the image of God. Perfectly Crafted. Wonderfully Made. Dearly Loved.  Mom, we have to be her role model. We must believe what God says about our beauty - we must speak about our own beauty in a positive light  because our girls are listening!

Once you are living in the freedom of God's beautiful creation (your body!) you are equipped to talk with your daughter about having a healthy body image. Dive in to scripture together: 1 Samuel 16:7, Psalm 139, Proverbs 31:30, Ephesians 2:10, 1 Peter 3:3-4. These verses share God's truth about image and appearance. Challenge each other to memorize these powerful Bible verses!

Let me remind you once more - you are her role model! She is watching what you eat, your exercise regimen, skin care routine and demeanor during "that time of the month." Self esteem rises and body image issues decrease as a result of feeling confident and comfortable with one's body. Living a healthy, active lifestyle can aid in this!

You can even create a series of "dates" to help reinforce the truth about body image. My girls and I wake up to green tea and kickboxing with Jillian Michaels! Start <a href="http://motherdaughterfitness.com/faq-exercise-program-to-help-child-lose-weight-and-build-self-esteem/">exercising</a> together, make healthy <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/creamsicle_breakfast_smoothie.html">smoothies</a>, calculate your <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/">BMI</a> and challenge one another to positive exercise and diet changes, have a <a href="http://www.tommynelson.com/2013/05/celebrate-motherhood-with-a-motherdaughter-spa-date/">spa day</a> where you teach her how to properly care for her hair, nails and skin.

Continue to verbally affirm her natural beauty. She's listening, remember? And, if you're anything like me, you could use the affirmation once in a while too.'

I can still see her perched on the shag carpet stairwell to our basement as she watched over giggling girls. Never can I remember falling asleep without my mother's watchful presence perched right where she belonged. Of course, I never knew she was supervising. I just thought she was having fun with us. She giggled more than any of the rest of us.

In recent years, slumber parties have come under the scrutiny of discerning moms. And for good reason: many times these parties are <em>not</em> well supervised, leaving the girls vulnerable to unfiltered Internet access and Netflix selections that you hope your daughter will never watch! (I write about this in more detail in my book <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/parents/products/six-ways-to-keep-the-little-in-your-girl">Six Ways to Keep the Little in Your Girl</a></i>.)

&nbsp;

Christian bloggers Tim Challies and Faith Tibbets McDonald saw first-hand the increasingly controversial nature of sleepovers in their summer blogs, <a href="http://www.challies.com/articles/6-reflections-on-sleepovers">6 Reflections on Sleepovers</a> and <a href="http://www.todayschristianwoman.com/articles/2000/july/losingsleepoversleepovers.html">Losing Sleep Over Sleepovers</a>?.  Both asked the same question, and both received a tremendous conglomeration of responses.  Should I allow my tweenager to sleep over?  Is it safe?  Frankly, it seemed that some had responses that were rather black and white. I'm not sure that's fair. Our communities are different. Our own personal stamina as moms is different. And, most importantly, our children are different. (Keeping my very verbal and extroverted Lexi Gresh from sleepovers when she was ten would have been like asking her not to breath!) I think there is more than one answer to the sleepover question!

&nbsp;

There are three reasonable responses.

1.) One is to have a “no sleepover” policy. I’ve had friends adopt this, and their daughters survive quite well despite what everyone around them says. My dear friend Kim adopted this for her girls, much to Lexi's lament since she adored her daughter. One reason for the decision was her daughters' commitment to ballet. The rigorous schedule of their lives didn't permit for sleepover hangovers the next day! It was the right decision for her and her daughters.

2.) The second is to let your daughter go to sleepovers only at homes where you know the family well and have confidence that what the girls will be doing is safe and morally appropriate. This policy is something I suggest you ease into when your daughter is 10, 11, or 12. Bob and I adopted this one and felt comfortable with our choice. Our daughters were always and only allowed to stay where we felt they were safe and the parents shared our moral values. It was never uncomfortable for me to tell the moms that I had to approve any movies that were shown. (And, I always made it clear that I'd pick my daughter up if everyone else was allowed to see a movie that she was not. Guess what? I did that once! Lexi lives to tell about it.)

3.) But I think the best option is to be the host home. (Like my mom! Frankly, I don't recall sleeping over at other houses at all. Maybe one. And then, I always wished I was at home.)

<i>“For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so he can do the good things he planned for us long ago.” (Ephesians 2:10)</i>

When my Lexi was nine, she went on her first missions trip to Zambia. God opened her eyes there to real need. Not, "But mom I need it" when she was hungry for a candy bar at the grocery store, but "Oh, mom! They don't have any food" in an orphanage where babies were crying from hunger.

When she returned, she recruited an entire neighborhood full of girls and started a fund raising project. She and her friends would sew bananas for dogs and sell them at the local craft festival. My office was home to a gaggle of girls for weeks who left sewing threads and fabric scraps that surely must be embedded in the carpet to this day. They raised hundreds of dollars and sent the money to Africa to help.

My baby did something "good."

Robert Coles, a pioneer in the field of moral intelligence, brings clarity to the definitions of <i>goodness</i> and <i>badness</i> when he writes:
<p style="text-align: center;">  <i>“good…[children]…have learned to take seriously the very notion, the desireability of goodness—living up to the Golden rule.”<a title="" href="#_edn1"><b>[i]</b></a> Whereas bad [children] display a “heightened destructive self-absorption, in all its melancholy stages.” In essence, we go bad when “we lose sight of our obligation to others.”<a title="" href="#_edn2"><b>[ii]</b></a></i></p>
Goodness is the quality that makes us put others ahead of ourselves. It’s the moral compass that keeps the world safe, happy, and working. It’s the drive that makes us want to function in families rather than isolation. It’s the internal road sign that takes us away from our own desires and toward the destiny of meeting the needs of others. Without it, we are “bad.” That’s probably why all of us–male and female—are called to goodness.
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">God <i>is</i> good.</b></p>
The ultimate reason we must raise our children to be good is that it reflects the character of God. God’s goodness is a bedrock truth of Scripture and an inseparable part of his character. If we are to be a picture of Him, we must possess goodness. He is good not only in a general sense, but he is good TO us and FOR us. This element of his character expresses his selflessness and desire to exist on behalf of others. When people are good they act TOWARD and FOR others, as opposed to losing sight of others as their own needs and desires consume them.

Of course, our children embrace being "good", if they see it in us. I'm constantly having to beat my to-do list in to submission so that I can have the flexibility to meet the needs of others. It's not easy in our culture to have space in our lives to care for each other, but we must.

Let's pray today that God would grow goodness in our children. And let us be willing to be an example of it!

<b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Ephesians 2:10:</b>

<em>Lord, you created my children. It is not difficult for me to see that (insert their names) are masterpieces crafted by you. Would you please help them to see it and understand it and know that the purpose of their greatness is to be good. Before they were created, you planned good things for them to do. Help me to guide them to those opportunities. Teach them to be outside of their own needs and get into the needs of others. Let it begin with my example. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“She is clothed with strength and dignity and laughs without fear of the future.” (Proverbs 31:25)</i></p>
Today I am putting one of my children on an airplane and I won't see her for six months. (Gulp.) Autumn is headed to Taiwan for a discipleship training and missions program, and my mother's heart goes with her but my eyes and my mind and my hands are staying behind. And I feel rather helpless.

It is not the first time I have released one into the world. The first time was when Robby went to kindergarten. (I cried then, too.)

I'm fairly convinced that there is an invisible maternal doppler radar system on the top of a mother's head. The detection wand circles our heads with a certainty that each child is where he or she should be according to the schedule we've reviewed over and over again...until the doppler system has nothing to go on and cannot find said children. Then, the detection circle beeps hazardously warning our spirit that no report on that child's EXACT whereabouts can be provided. I don't know about you, but it is then that I feel helpless. (Read: out of control.)

And, frankly, fellow mother...sometimes I act like it. My responses are not full of God's strength. (If they were, I would not have stress attacks, dump all my fears via texts on my husband, and be verbally severe in my conversation with Autumn as we go over her packing list.) Hmmmm...I've got so much growing up to do!

I started this devotion with the intention to help you pray over your child's future. (And we will.) With Autumn departing, my heart is focused like a laser beam on how these next six months will shape her future—much like yours might be as you send one off to kindergarten, get another started in the AWANA program, or decide whether to put one on the traveling soccer team. Each decision we make for our children now, hints at what they will become and gives us pause to pray.

We must be mothers who pray about our children's future. But in my spirit I'm being led to caution you that it is <em>our attitude about their future, not just their future</em> that God wants us to pray over today.

Our children are going to grow up. Step by step. Day by day. Year by year. With each passing phase, they will be less and less traceable as they march into the future. (I know that there are days where a bubble bath is much in order because they are far TOO traceable...as in always under your feet...but with the beginning of the school year we can ponder those releasings, too.) And we are called to a certain response in the letting go... Proverbs 31:25.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proverbs-31-25.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4899 aligncenter" alt="Proverbs 31-25" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proverbs-31-25-300x251.png" width="300" height="251" /></a>

&nbsp;

Laughing.

There should be more of it in my house at these crucial "letting go" times. If I'm truly clothed in his strength and dignity, stress will not spit out of my mouth nearly as quickly as laughter will roll out of it. When I walk my children to the bus in the morning...time to laugh and play not just rush. When I drive them home from piano...time to giggle about the songs their learning not just establish their practice schedule. When I send them off to high school...time to laugh about new friends not just warn them about bad ones. When I drive Autumn to the airport at 5:30 am this morning, time to laugh about the future...not just stress over it by running through instructions for getting through Chicago O'Hare ONE MORE TIME!

How about you, mom? Does the amount of laughter over life changes, schedules, decisions, and the letting go reflect that your heart is fueled by God's strength and you are clothed in dignity? Let's laugh at the future a little today, shall we?

After all, when we're in over our head it is still under his feet!
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Proverbs 31:25:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lord, I want to confess to you that I am often reactive and express more stress than strength. If I truly believe that you are in control of my children's future, my life will display that I'm clothed in your strength and dignity. I give the future of (insert names of your children) to you. I ask you to help me put on the garment of your strength and the beauty of dignity. Fill my home with laughter, not just when times are easy but when I'm considering the future and can become prone to worry. Help me to remember that anything over my head is still under your feet. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</em></p>

<i>“Then God said, “let us make man in our image, in our likeness…So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26,27)</i>

The other day I was playing with my Facebook account and was shocked to discover fifty-six gender options. They include “transgender,” (for those who feel their gender is different than their sex organs would suggest) “gender fluid,” (in case you like to go both ways) “male to female/mtf” (meaning a sex change is in the making), and you can add a suggestion if you can’t find one of the fifty-six that fit your preference. Please don’t write to Facebook and complain. My point is not for us to boycott anyone, but to raise an awareness in you that your child is growing up in a world that does not embrace the roles of male and female. And there will be a lot of pressure for him or her to embrace tolerance for all gender preferences. Unless, of course, your preference is to stick with God created: male and female. This must be bathed in prayer, mom.

Take another look at Genesis  1:26,27 again.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“Then God said, “let us make man in our image, in our likeness…So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” </i></p>

There are so many God-like qualities that humanity possesses. Why doesn’t God mention the traits of being intelligent or worshipful or creative when he says we were created in his image? Why doesn’t he commend our language proficiency or our ability to compose sonnets? Apparently these are not the things that make us most like a representation of God. It is our maleness and our femaleness that makes us like  Him. This places authentic humanity and sexuality in the context of male and female distinctiveness. Our ability to look like him mandates that we embrace those differences, not erase them.

The book of Romans teaches us much concerning this issue. Disregarding God's definitions for manhood and womanhood is a rebellious refusal to glorify him and an attempt to hide who he is and <i>whose</i> we are.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/“Disregarding-Gods-definitions-for.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4897 aligncenter" alt="“Disregarding God's definitions for" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/“Disregarding-Gods-definitions-for-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/genitalia-are-not-destiny-but-are-they-design">Pastor John Piper puts it this way</a>:
<blockquote><i>God’s divine nature is revealed in the physical, material universe. So much so that verse 20 says, “So they are without excuse” when they “exchange the glory of God for the glory of the creature” (verse 23), or when they “exchange the truth about God for a lie and worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator.” (verse 25).</i>

<i>Paul is saying that the material, physical universe reveals God’s true nature, and his design for humans to worship him.</i>

<i>Then Paul draws the parallel with human sexuality. Just as physical nature reveals the truth about God, so physical nature reveals truth about sexual identity. <em>Whom</em> we should worship is not left to our preferences, and <em>who we are</em> sexually is not left to our preferences. Both are dictated by God’s revelation in nature.</i>

<i>The parallel Paul is making is this: On the one hand, cosmology is designed by God to reveal truth about <em>God’s</em> identity (as powerful and divine); on the other hand, biology (anatomy) is designed by God to reveal truth about <em>our </em>identity (as male and female). This truth is so plain, Paul says, that we are “without excuse” if we don’t see it and agree with it.<a title="" href="#_edn1"><b>
</b></a></i></blockquote>
In Romans, the apostle Paul also begs for us to lay down our own plans for our bodies, and to make them daily, living, breathing sacrifices to our purpose of glorifying God. This includes how we work, live, give, spend and even who we have sex with no matter what gender “preference” might be tempting to us. Those verses read:
<blockquote><i>“I appeal to you therefore...by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12: 1,2)</i></blockquote>
Why did God make you a woman?

Because you were created to contribute to humanity’s purpose of glorifying and enjoying God, and God chose for you to do that as a woman. You illuminate who God is when you embrace the role of womanhood because it is in male and female distinctions that we are the image of God. There will be times when this is a sacrifice for you. And there will be times when it will be a sacrifice for your daughter, as well.

Will you give of yourself (as Christ did), renew your mind, and become a discerning woman of God so that your body may be a beautiful living sacrifice? Will you teach your children to do the same in this challenging world?

<p align="center"><em>By Dannah Gresh, Creator Secret Keeper Girl</em></p>
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Read: Isaiah 54:9-17</b></p>
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"></b><i>“All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.” Isaiah 54:13</i></p>
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">As I read Isaiah 54:9-17 today, the rain was pelting so hard against my window and the thunder clapping so loudly that I don’t have to imagine what worry Noah felt when the doors to the ark closed with a thud and a mere man heard wet and wild fury on the other side! It sounds like that in State College, Pennsylvania today. And I’m worried. I worry for my menagerie of barn animals. Is the barn flooding? Is sweet Kanga, our mini fainting goat who is struggling with a bout of lameness, able to make her way to shelter? Will one of my horses slip in the mud?</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">How storms—especially the emotional and spiritual ones—test our faith and rattle our foundation. Doesn’t matter how big (a child starting the school year with a frightening health diagnosis) or how small (a child having trouble making friends at the beginning of the school year), as moms we can be consumed by the storm at the expense of the peace God means for us to know. Each of my three children is facing mini-storms right now, and I’m worried. One is facing overload and stress like never before. Another is having a hard time finding a solid friend to share life with. And then there’s the one struggling with a life change. I just don’t like storms when they impact my children.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">It is such a storm we find in Isaiah 54.</span>

But look at the promises in the midst of it!

Mom, though the mountains shake and the hills be moved, “you will not be shaken,” Mom. “No weapon formed against you will prosper.”

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NO-WEAPON.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4894 aligncenter" alt="NO WEAPON" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NO-WEAPON-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Do you need that today? I sure do.

Nestled in the midst of all these promises for us, is one for our children: “great will be their peace.” I want this for my precious Rob (and his new fiance Aleigha), Lexi, and Autumn. Oh, how I want it! Do you want it for your children? So let’s figure out <i>how</i> it comes to them so we can be sure we cooperate in God's plan to bring it to them. Peace comes with a caveat. The whole verse reads, “Your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.”

A teacher cannot teach a student unless he or she places themselves in the presence of the teacher. Your child cannot be taught by the Lord unless he or she is still and sits under the instruction of the Holy Spirit. If we want our children to have peace in the midst of their storms, it will be found in the sitting.

And that comes for you and I, too. Let us not forget, we are Someone’s child. We are His child. He wants your peace to be great no matter what storm is around you. And that peace does not come from cleaning your house, crossing off your to-do list, managing your children’s schedules, or making <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/dannahgresh/meal-time/">Pinterest</a> worthy meals. (I don’t know about you but my Pinterest recipes never look like the picture, anyway!) The peace you are looking for doesn’t come from the doing. It comes from the sitting.

Sit at His feet if you are in need of peace. As His Spirit instructs your heart, it will be overwhelmed with peace. Mine was today.

And our children cannot learn this if we do not model it, my friend!
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Isaiah 54: 9-17</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lord, there are storms in our lives right now. They include (list them one by one). I feel the shaking of the mountains and the moving of the hills and I need to cling to your promise that neither I nor my children will be shaken. Help me to sit at your feet to be instructed no matter what my house looks like, no matter how big my to-do list may be, and no matter what the needs of my children are. I believe that if I put you first, you will teach me and that will bring peace.

Well, one thing is for sure our days and lives are CRAZY when we're on tour. Here's a taste of what it looks like behind the scenes including a look at the world's largest hamburger (a necessary tour survival tool at midnight) and the staggering gas bill that brings us to you each season.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Backstage.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4759 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Backstage-200x300.jpg" alt="Backstage" width="200" height="300" /></a>

<strong>FACT #1: Our brain is called MasterTour.</strong> Coordinating up to 50 tour stops in three months with a tour team of up to 12 and an off-road management team of only 4 takes a brain. And we have one. It's called MasterTour. Each team member has this app on our smart phone it tells us everything from when we get to sleep to what city we will be in tomorrow to who we will meet when we get there. Here's what our map looks like at the beginning of a season.

PIC
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Our tour map for Fall 2015<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FACT #2: Our bed is a bus.</strong> God blessed us last year with the ability to upgrade from van transportation/hotels to a tour bus that we sleep on while we drive. (Well only one of us drives and he doesn't sleep.) Shout out to NewSong who previously owned the bus and used it for WinterJam, the world's largest concert tour! We wake up each morning to the same view: the back side of a church parking lot (and maybe a team member like Haley having her morning beverage whilst sitting on the front dash. The glasses are mandatory since we don't get the chance to wash up before we're in the church. We don't want to scare anyone now, do we?)</p>
<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4771 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="photo" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year we travelled 37,223 miles in our tour bus and used $38,459 worth of gas. (That's a lot of gas!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #3: We blow up a lot of balloons each morning.</strong> Each event requires stage set up that takes us about 3 hours. No one gets the morning off. We all help set up lighting, sound equipment, staging pipe and drape, the resource table signs and banners, books, and lots and lots of balloons. The balloon sculptures for the stage take about an hour and require several volunteers from our host church (whom we love so much) managed by one team member such as Lexi who handles our 7' crazy hair column topper with expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4762 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons-300x252.png" alt="Balloons" width="300" height="252" /></a> <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4765 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n-225x300.jpg" alt="155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Last year we spent about 80 hours blowing up 17,760 balloons.</em></p>
<strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #5: We manage a lot of clothes and props backstage.</strong> From the world's largest chicken egg to a complete set of authentic vintage clothing from four different decades, our stage team manages all of its own props. We put them out in the morning and do a careful accounting of each item at the end of each night. Heather (vintage clothing coordinator) and Jordan ("It's Sew Crazy" tween fashion show designer) are seen below organizing one of our wardrobes last season.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4766 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n-300x225.jpg" alt="312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<em>The Crazy Hair Tour uses 111 props each night including the world's largest sling shot! </em>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #6: Every day we do a sound check.</strong> The last thing we do before daily team devos and lunch is our sound check. We're usually excited by this point because it means we're almost to the part of the day that we get "off." From about noon to four we get to hang out in our bus home or get a shower in a local hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4769 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n-225x300.jpg" alt="10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Charmaine...it might look like a sound check, but she's thinking about lunch.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #7: We eat at midnight.</strong> They say that being on stage for one hour is the equivalent of a 4 hour workout. Since we're on stage for nearly three hours, we are starving by the time the bus is loaded up and our pjs (comprised of sweat pants and sweat shirts) are on. We have been known to eat burgers the size of our heads (Lexi) and pizza no less worth talking about (Suzy) at midnight which is when we roll on out of one city and head to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4768 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger-294x300.png" alt="Burger" width="294" height="300" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year our food budget was $11,799. (We eat less than the bus, that's for sure!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After our midnight snack, it's off to bed in our trusty tour bus. And on to the next city to do it all over again!</p>

I don't know about everyone else, but I'm poised to contribute to a conversation that says men are good in an effort to dispel the myths perpetuated by lousy commercials that have been the norm for far too long. Move over myths, there's a #HowToDad movement on the prowl complete with advice on how to treat your wife and what to do when your son attempts to scare the tar out of you before your feet hit the ground.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Myths TV Perpetuates</strong></p>
We have a bad boy—as opposed to a good men— mentality in culture. One reason is that the a cultural movement told us they are bad. Michael Gurian, author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Boys-Michael-Gurian/dp/1585425281">The Wonder Of Boys</a></em>, though seeming to embrace the feminist movement as a whole points out a few devastating myths it introduced to convince our boys that they are “bad.” Here are two that resonate with me:
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Myth Number One:</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“that masculinity is responsible for the world’s ills and femininity is the world’s salvation.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Myth Number Two:</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“males destroy, females create; males stand in the way of positive spiritual/social values; males are inherently violent.”</em></p>
Just consider how prevalently these two myths are portrayed in the media. Television alone reinforces them with programs like Modern Family where the guys are sweet, but stupid. (Even the reruns of The Simpsons portray the contrast between bright and beautiful Lisa and stupid and out-of-shape Bart.) Co-ed television commercials often portray the guy as ditzy and the girl as smart. It’s funny. It really is. But how much of it can we expose ourselves to before we believe it? How much can our sons and husbands be exposed to before they plummet into self-fulfilling prophecy mode?

Today’s men as a whole have pretty much rolled over and taken it. But this viral Cheerio ad gives me hope. Hope that boys can be taught to grow up to be good men
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> Goodness vs. Badness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robert Coles, a pioneer in the field of moral intelligence, brings clarity to the definitions of goodness and badness when he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“</em>good…boys…have learned to take seriously the very notion, the desireability of goodness—living up to the Golden rule.” Whereas bad boys display a “heightened destructive self-absorption, in all its melancholy stages.” In essence, we go bad when “we lose sight of our obligation to others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Goodness is the quality that makes us put others ahead of ourselves. (And this quality is so vibrant and visible in the Cheerio's ad.) Goodness is the moral compass that keeps the world safe, happy, and working. It’s the drive that makes us want to function in families—from waking up with scary horse masks up our nostrils to making coffee for each other— rather than isolation. It’s the internal road sign that takes us away from our own desires and toward the destiny of meeting the needs of others. Without it, we are “bad.” That’s probably why all of us–male and female—are called to goodness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with goodness.”
Romans 12:21</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The New Testament Greek word for “goodness”—used here and in other places— appears in three forms, all of which are rooted in the Hebrew word “tob”, which meant “usefulness.” Are we bringing up boys who understand their call of duty to be useful contributors to society? One important component of helping boys understand their duty, is portraying it in the mediums of our culture. That's why I think the Cheerio's ad is an epic victory for those of us who believe that men are good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. Someone go buy some Peanut Butter Cheerios and send a message that we like this message. A lot.</p>

Unlit. Unretouched. Un-size-0! Robyn Lawley is proof that a size 12 is not a plus size. (The modeling industry categorizes anyone over a size 6 as plus.)

While not every teen or tween girl should see these photos, many should. It might make them think differently about their own body.

A picture is worth a thousand words.

Here are some conversation starters if you decide to take time to look at Lawley's <a href="http://www.myfoxchicago.com/story/26102615/australian-model-posts-untouched-bikini-photo">unretouched (and often immodest) photo library</a>.
<blockquote>•This model tried to get smaller, but couldn't. Based on the photos, do you think she needed to be smaller?

•You begin to believe anything you dwell on. Knowing this and seeing the truth in these photos, do you think it's a good idea to feast on fashion magazines?

•If the modeling industry is not representing all sizes, but represent anorexic (eating disorder) sizes what does this say about who they represent? Should we want to look anorexic?

•Since we can't get a true picture of beauty (literally) from the modeling world, where should we look?</blockquote>

<em>We posted it as a question for moms to discuss and it got a little "opinionated." One mom even defended the fact that her daughter just thinks it is fun and punctuated it by posting an adorable photo of her and her girl giving us "duck face!" I, Dannah, asked Secret Keeper Girl lead teacher Charmaine Porter to weigh in. And...here she is with a really silly "duck face"!</em>

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-1-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4735 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-1-3-225x300.jpg" alt="photo 1 (3)" width="225" height="300" /></a>

The photography phenomenon, known as “duck face” seems to have taken the social media world by storm recently. It started on television, in fashion magazines, celebrities picked up the trend. And NOW it’s trickled down to your little girl! Is it OK?

Because of the world we live in, our children tend to associate beauty with what they see on Facebook, Instagram, and on TV and movies. Since celebrities and models do the duck face, the thinking in a tween girl might be like this: "The world has deemed this celebrity/model as beautiful… she is making the duck face… maybe I need to do that to be beautiful as well."

It’s normal and natural that your daughter wants to be and feel beautiful and there’s nothing wrong with that. After all, moms, don’t you want to feel and be beautiful as well? But, as we say on the Secret Keeper Girl tour, Christians are supposed to go a bit beyond what’s normal and right into unique and crazy for Jesus! Let's analyze "duck face" in this light.

1.) <em><strong>Your daughter may have pure and simply silly intentions when she makes "duck face." </strong></em>After seeing a comment posted by a mom and totally agreeing with her, I feel this should where we begin. The main issue with “duck face” is not the act itself but the motivation and heart behind it. So as you communicate and discuss this with your child, if “duck face” is just a fun, silly thing she likes to do, then by all means, LET HER PLAY! And, as one mom suggested, play with her and be a part of those silly photos. She’s a child with a fun personality and that shouldn’t be quenched.

2.) <em><strong>If your daughter's intentions don't seem pure and silly, dig a little deeper in conversation to see what they might be.</strong> </em>Ask her WHY she is posing that way. Why is she contouring her face ? Ask her WHO she saw posing like that if that person is someone she truly desires to model or emulate. Many of the models and celebs who pose like this do have trashy sensual intentions. I'm not the only one who thinks this either: “[Duck face] is meant to be seductive, although why anyone would think ducks are sexy, I don't know.”[1] As an example, here's a carefully cropped photo of one of this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SImodel.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4738" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SImodel-300x195.jpg" alt="SImodel" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
While your daughter may not think sexually about her lips at all, make sure she's not copying sensual behavior and believing it to be "beauty." If this is what's in her head, explain to her the intentions of the models and that copying that kind of behavior is not ok.

3.) <em><strong>Use the conversation as a chance to discuss what God's word says about our beauty.</strong></em> Turn to the Word of God. While we won’t find mention of "duck faces" in the Bible, we do see that even back in Biblical times, people were more concerned with outward than inward beauty. There truly is nothing new under the sun! A great place to start is with this favorite Secret Keeper Girl verse:
<blockquote>"Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or beautiful clothes. You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so precious to God." I Peter 3:3-4 (NLT)</blockquote>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">A good modern day paraphrase might read: "Don't be concerned about outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, beautiful clothes, or carefully posed duck face selfies!" True beauty can’t be captured in a pose or photograph. True beauty and attractiveness is not found in duck lips.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">It comes from the presence of God.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">There is nothing wrong with wanting to be and feel beautiful; it’s one of the most fun things about being a girl! So let’s model and teach your daughter to make sure that her heart is even more beautiful than how she looks on the outside. Talk. Discuss. Ask questions. Let her speak. And above all else, encourage her to spend more time in the mirror of God’s word discovering how “look” truly beautiful (more like Him) and a little less time practicing silly poses in the mirror trying to mimic the latest trend.</p>

<h3>What does the Secret Keeper Girl Event Look  Like?</h3>
Just push play for a peak at some of last year's fun!

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sOPlBUdrh2g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h3>What is Secret Keeper Girl?</h3>
Secret Keeper Girl is a program that is the brainchild of the dynamic <a href="http://purefreedom.org/meet/dannah/">Dannah Gresh</a>. Gresh is an author and speaker who wants girls to know that they are more than what society tells them they are. Out of this idea came the book “Secret Keeper.” This book teaches girls about the necessity of maintaining their modesty and keeping appropriate relationships with boys until they are married. Secret Keeper Girl offers advice and interaction for moms and tween girls. For example, “<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/petition/">The Modesty Project</a>” is a petition started in 2009 to encourage designers to make more modest clothing for girls. And, we have "date” kits for mothers and daughters to have fun while discussing important topics.
<h3>What is the current Crazy Hair Tour Like?</h3>
If you ever wanted an opportunity to really let your hair down, the <em>Crazy Hair Tour</em> is it.

First, you and your daughter can dress as fashionably silly and fun as you want, as long as it is modest. Then, if you are feeling it, you can pick the craziest hairstyle you can imagine.

Once you arrive at the event, you will be swept up in a storm of excitement. The <em>Crazy Hair Tour</em> is a game show and fashion show rolled into one. You can enjoy competing in the games, learning about current fashion, and see how the Bible stays relevant, even in modern times. The point of the show is to help persuade girls to be “God-crazy” instead of boy-crazy. That way, they will get more direction from the Bible, and take less advice from fashion magazines.
<h3>Who wants to go?</h3>
This event is targeted at Tween girls (ages 8-12) and their moms. It is popular for the girls because the show gets you up on your feet and the fun never stops. Moms like it because it spreads a message they feel is hard to get across, as girls get more and more influence from worldly people and agendas. There are <a href="http://purefreedom.org/tour">many stops on the Crazy Hair Tour</a> this fall, in the following states:
<ul>
	<li>Florida</li>
	<li>Tenneessee</li>
	<li>Mississippi</li>
	<li>Iowa</li>
	<li>South Carolina</li>
	<li>North Carolina</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania</li>
	<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

My heart was just bursting with the good work God had done at our recent FREE outreach event with Brooklyn Tab just a few weeks earlier. So, I got on the stage and told the moms and girls of Tennessee about it. About how my team prayed one-on-one until each and every sexually broken mom or girl had been loved on. How we left behind a partner—Brooklyn Tab— with the strength to continue walking with them, but just a little more fueled and armed to do battle for them. How I'd prayed with the most precious little girl to receive Jesus as her Lord and Savior...and the photographer had caught me kissing her on the head.

We LOVE reducing the risk of early sexual debut and brokenness in high risk pockets of community. It is our greatest honor to encourage girls to write a different legacy than their community expects them to write.

I stood up filled with the passion of having just seen God's Spirit rescuing girls...for the fourth time in Brooklyn. And how we've had to say "no" to requests in Detroit, Philadelphia, and even overseas. I told those moms and girls in Tennessee all the details.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4536 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n-300x200.jpg" alt="1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Then they told me something. Those moms and girls of Tennessee told me and my team that they wanted the answer to be "yes" from now on.

How did they tell us?

With dollars. Lots of them. And before we knew it we had funding to do more outreach events. We've already fully funded grant events in the following locations and located event coordinators who are so full of the hope and love of God that they want to pour it out where it's been missing. In the fall we will go to:
<ul>
	<li>Belle Glades, Florida (Ashley Tripp)</li>
	<li>A suburb of Richmond, VA (Truin Huntley - First Things First)</li>
	<li>East Liverpool, OH (Cindy Popejoy)</li>
</ul>
And, while the majority of our funding will stay right here in the United States, we are planning a very important trip for next year to bring sexual wholeness to girls experiencing "survival sex" in Haiti.

Moms and girls at our live events have blessed us so much that we thought we should name this gentle, but strong move of God's Spirit for girls to help girls. So, we have.

Mother/Daughter kitchen dates are some of the best, right Mom?

<strong>Purple Flurp</strong> is featured in one of our <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens">Secret Keeper Girl Fiction Series</a> books, <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens/products/danikas-totally-terrible-toss">Danika’s Totally Terrible Toss</a></i>. Danika takes some of her mom's famous Purple Flurp dessert to school. But, it's not eaten… something goes terribly wrong! (You'll have to read to learn what happened!)

We recently had a mom and daughter write in and ask us if  Purple Flurp is a real recipe. You bet it is!
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Secret Keeper Girl Purple Flurp</b></p>

You’ll need:
<ul>
	<li>1 can of crushed pineapple</li>
	<li>1 can of blueberry pie filling</li>
	<li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
	<li>1 8 oz. tub of Cool Whip</li>
</ul>
Mix the three canned items together and refrigerate them overnight. Add the tub of Cool Whip right before you serve it to all your friends. This Secret Keeper Girl tried it and said, "It's super good!"

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How can I simply make conversation with my daughter? I don’t know what to talk about. </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Sometimes it does seem like girls do speak a different language. Many fathers have been clueless at times too! Have you ever said something to your princess that evokes sudden anger or a waterfall of tears?  You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? What did I say wrong this time?

Even if she tires to shut you out or “doesn’t want to talk to dad about it,” there are tried and true ways to make conversation with your daughter that often opens up the door to her heart.

It’s that inner child thing. Stop and try to remember what it was like to be her age. Consider the things you loved, the things you hated, the things you cared about. It really isn’t probably all that far off.

As men, it really is amazing some of the things we put to memory. You probably know the stats for your favorite sports team. Countless song lyrics. Random facts about technology. Stock numbers… Study your daughter - know her like you know your favorite team; after all she is far more important to you, right?

Think of it this way: <strong><i>you should date your daughter</i></strong>. If you're still stumped, check out <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/8-great-dates-for-dads-and-daughters-understanding-boys"><em>8 Great Dates for Dads and Daughters</em></a> to get started! What questions would you ask on a regular date? Do you know her teacher’s name?  Who in her class has a “boyfriend”? Why she dislikes PE so much?  What’s her favorite song? If you can’t answer all of those questions confidently, you’ve got plenty to talk about! The time that she actually will <i>want</i> to spend talking to you will all-too-quickly come to a close. Don't take that time for granted - start with these:
<ul>
	<li>Who is your best friend? Why? What do you like about him/her?</li>
	<li>What is your biggest goal this year? How can I support you?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite meal?</li>
	<li>What makes you worry?</li>
	<li>If someone gave you $50, how would you spend it?</li>
	<li>What would you like to do when you grow up?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite activity we do together?</li>
	<li>What makes you feel loved?</li>
	<li>What is your dream vacation destination?</li>
	<li>Who do you consider to be your hero and why?</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How Can I Spend Quality Time With My Daughter If I Really Don’t Have That Much Time to Spare? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
The Pew Research Center conducted the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/14/men-women-work-time/1983271/">American Time Use Survey</a> in 2012 and discovered that fathers spend 7 hours with their children per week – much of that time involves technology (meaning you’re parked in front of the tv or computer). Convicting much? We must make time! Simple as that. She needs you! Yes, work and responsibilities are an important and necessary part of life. However, if your daughter feels that work is more important to you than she is, it might be a good time to reevaluate your schedule and priorities. Ask her. I dare you.

Consider when you really do have time to be fully focused on her. Block that time off and plan intentional activities or events and put them on your calendar in advance. It is so easy to become wrapped up in work, busyness and the full-plate that comes with parenthood, that we forget how to slow down, have fun and enjoy life. Put away your laptop, turn off your cell phone, and genuinely be with her. Even if you’re not able to have the quantity of time with your daughter that you’d like, make sure the time you do spend is quality time.

Using the time, energy and resources you do have, rekindle your creativity and get in touch with the child inside you.  Capitalize on her interests. Do what you know <i>she</i> would enjoy. Maybe you should go camping or fishing for a weekend. Have mornings free? Take her out to breakfast once a week before school and work begin. She won’t remember the deadline you had or the make-or-break meeting you were stressing about, but she will remember the intentional times you made her your sole focus and priority. She just needs you. All of you. Your focus, energy and attention. Make the time. When she is 18 and pulling out of your driveway for college you will wish you had more of it.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>How can I build my daughter’s confidence? </i></strong></p>
</blockquote>
While you can and should verbally affirm your daughter on a daily basis, I find that teaching her something seems to boost her confidence level. I believe that the handyman does not always have to be a guy. Spend quality time with her by teaching her: how to fix the toilet when it overflows, car maintenance, setting a mousetrap, finding the water main, repairing the fence, painting the wall – even killing a spider. It can be empowering for her to know that she is strong and capable and that she doesn’t always need a rescuer to do it for her.

Teaching her life skills like budgeting, yard work, and house repairs equip her to be self-sufficient and teach her that she can be independent. Build her up and encourage her as you work on projects together. Let her have a shot at it. We’re already proud of our daughters – but sometimes it’s nice to watch her be proud of herself.'

<em>Hey Secret Keeper Girl Dads!</em>

<em>It's about time we offered some tips to you! We imagine you have just a few questions about your tween daughter, like “Is she really from another planet?” In this blog series, Bob Gresh, author of <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/8-great-dates-for-dads-and-daughters-understanding-boys">8 Great Dates for Dads and Daughters</a> will answer some of the most frequently asked questions we receive from Dads.</em>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Is it OK to be involved in my daughter's dating life when she's older?</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Ummm… YES. It’s not ok for you <i>not </i>to be involved! I firmly believe in interviewing the gentlemen who have taken interest in my girls. Lord knows I’ve put a few young men through the most intensely awkward interview of their life! It was not at all to demonstrate my power as Dad, but to protect my girls and create a system of accountability and expectation for the boy driving them to the movie theater.

I wouldn’t wait until she’s older… I would get involved in her dating life NOW. When she’s 10 it’s much easier to express your desires for her dating relationships as well as family rules and boundaries than when she’s 16.

At some point, you have to tell your kids point-blank what your standards and expectations are. We adopted the dating protocol of the LaHayes after reading their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Sexually-Pure-Kids-Children/dp/1576733920"><i>Raising Sexually Pure Kids</i></a>. We decided to let our kids go on group dates for special events as soon as they hit high school. That means they could go on a chaperoned formal event, if they wanted, at the age of 14 or 15.

Our teenagers were allowed to go on single dates when they were 16, as long as we were actively involved in the planning and execution of the evening. What do I mean by “actively involved”? Well, Lexi and Autumn always knew that a guy who wanted to take them out has to go through an interview with me. Period. If the boy seemed to have honorable intentions and was someone we felt comfortable with, we most likely allowed them to spend a carefully planned, very public evening together. We were approving everything they did, and they were in close contact with us.

Finally, we discouraged our girls from being in any exclusive relationships until they were out of high school. We really wanted them to enjoy their high school years free from the drama relationships tend to bring, and we didn’t want their heart wounded by excessive relationships.

I can’t overestimate the importance of establishing and communicating your family’s dating standards when your daughter is a tween, even if that seems difficult. I also can’t understate how easy it is. My kids’ hearts were so innocent that it was just comfortable and natural to discuss. My girls still thought boys had cooties! It’s easy to establish your standards if you do so before their hormones kick in and “everyone else” has a boyfriend.

The young men who show an interest in your daughter and desire to spend time alone with her need us to hold them accountable for their actions, words and thought life. There is a huge need for more men – older men, dads, youth pastors – to challenge them to protect our daughters, their sisters in Christ, and do what is necessary to guard their heart as well as their purity.

Dennis Rainey, President and CEO of FamilyLife raised four beautiful daughters and wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interviewing-Your-Daughters-Date-Man-To-Man/dp/1602005257"><i>Interviewing Your Daughter’s Date</i></a><i>.</i> It is a great resource to consider when your daughter begins to date.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How do I talk to my daughter about her period? Should I acknowledge it? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Yes, I said "her period." Breathe, man. It’s not rocket science. Your daughter is growing up way too fast before your very eyes and there isn’t a thing you can do to stop it. If you’re anything like me, this can be very difficult to watch… after all, she is our <i>little </i>girl.

Nearly forty percent of girls starting their period have never heard about it from their parents. It’s not uncommon for girls to approach this phase of puberty and suddenly feel uncomfortable around Dad. She might not want you to hug her or love on her the same way you’ve always done. She may suddenly become embarrassed or stand-offish. Girls are often confused by their body changes and are embarrassed to talk about it… especially with you.

You might think this is “mom’s job.” Well, the truth is, the best way for you to help your daughter transition into womanhood is to get involved. Don’t skip out on this important event in your daughter’s life! Yes, it’s probably going to seem really awkward… you want to show your daughter support; that you’re compassionate and understanding of everything going on in her heart, life and body. When she sees this in you, it’s likely she will become more accepting of the changes and confident as a result.

I know this is a hard one – but you will survive. It’s so worth knowing that your daughter doesn’t feel she has to hide from you or feel embarrassed by you knowing. The more open you can be with your girl; the more honest and transparent you can be – the better off she will be! One of the greatest things you can offer your daughter, especially when she begins her period is your love, approval and acceptance.

Consider celebrating this milestone with an extra-special date night or a meaningful letter or gift. Show her you’re on her team. You.will.be.ok. Remind her that she will always be your little girl and you love her just the same.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>How can I enforce modesty in a way my daughter respects?</i></strong></p>
It’s likely you’ve seen <i>that</i> dad who wore super short shorts out in public to “teach his daughter modesty.” Funny for the rest of us. "Way to go Dad," right? I don’t know about the daughter though. Something was needed to prove his point, but I think intentional public humiliation is not always the best. Point being, encouraging our daughters to be modest can be a great undertaking.

Have you heard this statement? “But DAD… Everyone else is wearing it.” Don’t underestimate your influence when it comes to modesty. Your approval is extremely important to your daughter. Before you resort to the short-shorts method, go shopping with her. I realize this might not be your favorite activity, but the girls seem to respect their fathers more when we are willing to show interest and have an input in the selection process, knowing modest clothing can be very hard to find.

Have her try on the clothes and model for you. Affirm her natural beauty and be cautious in how you address “inappropriate” clothes. Your language and your tone matter to her confidence. Yes, I know you’re in a mall. In a girl’s store. Shopping. Please be patient and tender toward her. Point out the positive, "I really like the color of that shirt - It brings out your eyes. Maybe we can find one in another size."  A little affirmation before your "It's too tight/short/see through..." will help her be more responsive to your opinion.

Along with overseeing your daughter’s closet and shopping trips, it’s important we lead them to the Word to show them God’s perspective on true beauty and modesty as well as the temptations and struggles of men. Without clear standards reinforced by scripture, modesty will become simply rules she resents rather than a lifestyle she embraces.'

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Does my relationship with her mother really affect my daughter? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Yes. Yes it does.  John Wooden is quoted for saying, <i>“The greatest thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.”  </i>In loving her mother well, you’re not only teaching her about love, loyalty, compassion, respect, commitment, trust and tenderness, you are demonstrating it before her very eyes.  You can show her by the way you love and honor your wife that she should never settle for less than that. She will learn from <i>you</i> what qualities to look for and expect in a future husband.

I understand that some of you reading this come from broken relationships. Even if your daughter’s mother is now your ex, there is a godly way to honor her, to speak highly of her, and bless her. Your daughter is watching and she is watching more closely than you think.

If you are currently in a toxic or unhealthy relationship, that is not positively changing or if you’re not receiving counsel, you are essentially telling your daughter that this is <em>ok </em>for her future. If one day your daughter came home and told you she was in a similar relationship being treated the way you (or your wife) is, how would you feel? Would your heart break for her? You’re setting the bar. As the leader of your home, you set the tone and the pace for your wife and your children. I encourage you to genuinely and increasingly love her mother. Treat her with respect and a decent amount of PDA! When your little girl grows up it’s likely she will look for a man who treats her much like the way you treated her mom.

Be the dad that comes home and kisses your wife in front of the kids. They may scream or cover their eyes and say, “Ewwwww” but they will <em>know</em> you love her. Don't let that even  be a question in your child's mind! Your daughter will recognize that she wants a husband like you some day.

Strive to love her mother. Love her well. Love her better each day. Your daughter needs to see love demonstrated. Ready, set, go.'

Hopefully, you're daughter was all tucked into bed when the Grammy's started out with grinding Sunday night, but it's likely that some girls her age—perhaps friends at school—were glued to the television. Pre-show media touted the 2014 Grammy Awards as a family affair. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/table-talk-2014-grammy-awards_n_4660600.html">Huffington Post</a> even offered a table talk guide and ideas to help kids "cultivate the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the contribution of recorded music to American culture."

But what the world saw—from grinding to explicit lyrics to darkly themed performances to a "church" service— was not appropriate for young viewers, and you may need help navigating post-show conversations with your kids whether they saw the show or are just hearing about it from friends. And—whether you realize it or not—there really is something worth talking about.

Her name is Natalie Grant.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Natalie-Grant.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4012 aligncenter" alt="Natalie-Grant" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Natalie-Grant-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

&nbsp;

Grammy-nominated, five-time Dove Award winning recording artist Natalie Grant has found herself in a Hurricane. (Appropriate, due to her current chart-topping song.) She's been assaulted by media attention that's fueled with criticism–and a sprinkling of approval— for leaving the Grammy's. (I can only begin to image what it looks like in the eye of her media hurricane because when I posted a news article about her leaving the Grammy's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dannah-Gresh/204435266257157?ref=hl">my Facebook</a> post was viewed by over six million people! And the nearly 5,000 comments were often heated and divisive.)

Natalie has not publicly stated why she and her husband decided to leave, but was careful to tell people of her choice when she tweeted:
<blockquote><em><strong>@NatalieGrant</strong></em>
(1 of 2) We left the Grammy’s early. I’ve many thoughts, most of which are probably better left inside my head. But I’ll say this:

I’ve never been more honored to sing about Jesus and for Jesus. And I’ve never been more sure of the path I’ve chosen.</blockquote>
I think that Natalie has placed into our hands one of the greatest life lessons your daughter will ever get to see and it's worth talking about. Here are a few important points I'd make when talking to my daughters (or sons).

<strong>1.) Sometimes God's Spirit calls Christians to be in places where He is not welcomed.</strong> A lot of the Christians criticizing Natalie have stated that she shouldn't have been at the Grammy's to begin with. (One pastor, confusing me for Natalie, posted this to my Facebook page:
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">So proud of your stand...</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">now promise to never go to this kind of trash again.</h5>
</blockquote>
That thinking wreaks of legalism and a lack of relying on the Holy Spirit. Sometimes God's Spirit calls us to be light in the darkness.

I remember a time when my Lexi was only twelve years old and I dropped her off at pottery class. The basement studio was small and each week had a new art galleria in the lobby. On this particular night the display was purely Satanic and pointedly spiritual. Sensual sculptures of Adam and Eve. Burned out clay skeletons. And at the back of the gallery a large Bible opened to a page in Revelation. Every word had been blacked out except three which went connected made this sentence: "God. Is. Dead." Everything in me wanted to take Lexi and run. (And to give the owner a piece of my mind.) Instead, I prayed. And God seemed to be telling me to let her stay. I spent then next hour prayer walking the block.

Do you know that the displayed opened up a spiritual conversation during class, particularly of the existence of heaven and hell? And my sweet Lexi, arms deep in slippery clay, lovingly testified of her faith to her Agnostic teacher and a teen in the class who said she was an Atheist.

I think Natalie's work is marked with God's spirit. So she and her husband Bernie probably sensed God giving them a green light to go to the Grammy's. And clearly, while they were sitting in the audience they had an on-going conversation with the Holy Spirit who prompted them to leave. What a great example for our children! How I would have loved to have talked about Natalie's decision with my Lexi when she was twelve.

I've said this before, but let me say it again:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT ABOUT RAISING YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SET APART IN THIS CORRUPT CULTURE, YOU WILL BECOME A PARANOID MOTHER WHOSE LEGALISM DOES NOT ALLOW HER CHILDREN TO FACE THE GIANTS GOD MEANS FOR THEM TO FACE!</p>
</blockquote>
Natalie and her husband faced their own Goliath at the Grammy's. And I think they were called to it. It would be great if the Church gave her an "atta girl" rather than added to the criticism. We can't quiet those that say hurtful things, but what we can do as mothers is teach our daughters to follow in Natalie's footsteps.

<strong>2.) God always asks us to stand against evil. </strong>Turn in your own Bibles to Ephesians 6 and read verses 10-20 with your kids. Have them circle each time the word "stand" is used.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your <strong>stand</strong> against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to <strong>stand</strong> your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. <strong>Stand</strong> firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.</p>
</blockquote>
Explain to your children that when we face (or see) evil, the person or group of people involved isn't the source of evil. ("Our struggle is not with flesh and blood.") Therefore, we aren't called to argue, debate, accuse, or label. That's not what the verse instructs.

Instead, we are simply called to "stand." <strong><em>This is a silent but strong action.</em></strong>

We are also called to fearlessly declare the gospel. That is, the name of Jesus and his love for this lost world. (Again note: we are not called to argue, debate, accuse, or label but to speak the name and love of Christ.)

When Natalie posted what she did on Twitter, she was standing but not name calling or debating. The one name she did honor with verbal affirmation was the name of Jesus. Hers was a display of Ephesians 6 at it's best.

<strong>3.) God does not always require us to speak out against evil.</strong> When Jesus was on the earth the Roman culture was corrupt. King Herod was a brutal, baby-killing murder. The Olympics were a hedonistic, pagan religious festival. Many wanted Jesus to speak out against these things.

He didn't.

He just loved.

It is critical that we have a solid Biblical theology about music, sexuality, occult activity and more. In our Bible studies, church meetings and conferences we SHOULD talk about these things. <strong><em>But do we bring the lost closer to Jesus by telling them that they are bad? Usually not. I've never won someone to Christ by convincing them that they are wrong and I am right</em></strong>.

They come to Christ because they feel loved. By Him through me.

Natalie has chosen not to speak out against any specific songs, lyrics, actions or artists. For those who are trying to make this about one single performance or issue, here is what Natalie posted on her Facebook page Monday:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"I've tried to read all of the comments on my previous post but I can't respond to them all. Most of you have always been so supportive and encouraging to me &amp; I'm grateful. It does sadden me when people argue, judge and hurl insults at each other from both sides of the fence. I'm not going to engage in arguments, but just have a few things I'd like to say:<br data-reactid=".f.1:3:1:$comment578144675609524_3493718:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.0:3.0.3.0.$end:0:$1:0" />I NEVER said I left during any particular performance.

I hate no one. And I believe that every person has been created in the image of God. I will never stand on a street corner and wave a sign, I won't use my platform to engage in political arguments that will only divide and not unite. I will continue to pray that my life will be my message. I do have my own personal convictions that I live by, and I will continue to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord.

<p style="text-align: left;">A brilliant, humble, and well-spoken testimony. Full of the courage to stand and the name of Jesus. Void of name-calling and arguing. This is one "celebrity" our daughter's can learn from. So, let's talk about it with them!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your daughter is going to have friends who are lost. They will act in ways they should not, listen to music that is vulgar, and maybe even make sexual choices that are contrary to God's word.</p>
She will not win them to Jesus unless she loves them.

Our inner city outreach is entirely FREE to moms and daughters in NYC. The first 500 mom/daughter(s) will leave with a bag of FREE resources to bring them closer to each other and to Jesus. This includes a Secret Keeper Girl Mother/Daughter 8 Great Dates Book, A Secret Keeper Girl Bible Study, and a 1 Girl Nation CD. At the end of the night, we minister to these moms and daughters in prayer for as long as they need it. (Here's one of my favorite photos from our first inner city outreach in 2011.)

My team has been trying to get me' at line 1 for query UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = 'I was standing in line to check out at my pharmacy the other day when I saw the most frightening sight. A teeny-tiny barely-there skirt clinging to boney hips was all that stood between me and a clear view of the most skeletally thin legs I'd seen on a grown woman in my life: thigh gap! My team has been trying to get me to blog about it, but until I saw it first hand I didn't realize how horrifying it really can be. The young woman in front of me looked a lot like this photo, which I found at the proud blog of an anorexic.  As unattractive as you might find this, all-too-many tween and teen girls find it appealing...sexy even. And they'll do anything to achieve it. And many girls who obsess about thigh gap, end up struggling with eating disorders.

<em>Think your daughter is to bright to fall for that?</em> You might consider that it's often the brightest and most promising young girls that fall for anorexia.

<em>Think your daughter's too young to fall for that?</em> Anorexia often hits girls in their tween years, not their teen years, with some eating disorder clinic patients being as young as five. (Bulimia tends to hit when a girl is older.)

So let's muscle up our minds, moms! And be brave enough to have real conversations about a real problem. Here are five things you need to discuss with your daughter.

<strong>1.) Ask her if she knows about thigh gap and what she thinks about it?</strong> Your daughter's body condition, the existence or lack of a thigh gap, and conversation about it will not be what clues you in to a problem. In general, girls who loathe their bodies don't wake up one day and say, "Hey, mom. I really hate my body. I think I'll starve myself until I achieve thigh gap. Yeah! A little miserable anorexia sounds just great!" You have to ask. I have two especially thin daughters and we have open conversations about their weight and how they feel about themselves. This always begins with me asking about trends and just hearing their heart on the matter. You might also note if there is a sudden interest in diet or exercise, as sometimes that is a sign of the obsession.

<strong>2.) Explain to her that a thigh gap is not about how skinny a person is, but how their bone structure was formed at birth</strong>. Doctors warn that very few women have the true bone structure that leads to thigh gap naturally and healthfully. I found this great illustration on a <a href="http://fitnesstreats.tumblr.com/post/29683222718/hi-im-on-my-way-to-losing-weight-and-one-of-the">women's health and nutrition site</a>. You might share it with your daughter.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3529 aligncenter" alt="tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>3.) Show her photos of photoshopped thigh gap and explain that it's usually not real.</strong> Then, show her examples of real women in video or photos where you can see how a woman is supposed to look. (No gap!) As much as you'd like to think she never sees these kinds of photos, she probably does. It's better to show them to her and talk about it than to pretend they don't exist.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/21lud1e.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3530 aligncenter" alt="21lud1e" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/21lud1e-300x287.jpg" width="300" height="287" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>4.) Explain to her the risk of reducing body fat to the point of actually having "thigh gap."</strong> Risks include harming your body to the point of creating "brain gap." You better believe it. Losing too much weight can impact your brain, heart, lungs. It can also lead to loss of her period if she's already cycling. Nothing good comes of excessive weight loss.

<strong>5.) Above all, pray!</strong> I remember reading in Beth Moore's "Feather's From My Nest" of the account of praying her daughter <a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/inspirationalteaching/moore_magazines.aspx">Melissa's struggle</a> with an eating disorder. Oh, how that mama prayed. And called down the power of heaven to reduce the stronghold in Melissa's mind to rubble. What a glorious day it was when her daughter realized that she was feasting her eyes on images that were unattainable and unholy and asked her mother to come help her take magazine pages off her bedroom wall! Remember, whatever we worship and dwell on will inform what we believe about ourselves.

At the risk of sounding sacreligious and trite (but, oh, I rely on a lotta laughter to get me through the ugliest stuff), I invite you to share with your daughter these "celebs" who really do have real "thigh gap!" Perhaps that will curb her appetite!

Therefore, I'm often fielding questions on related topics including the HPV vaccination, Gardasil, which the Center For Disease Control recommends for girls and boys aged 11 and 12 (though it can be given as early as year nine). I'm not a medical professional, and you should seek the advice of a variety of professionals in the field before you make a decision because you will find their opinions varied. Here are a few facts and some links to those whose opinion I sought before decided that I would wait a little longer to decide if I will administer the vaccine to my girls. For now, I'm choosing not to do so.

<strong>What is HPV?</strong>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus">HPV</a> is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States of America. It is a common denominator in all cases of cervical cancer. There are approximately 30-40 strains of the virus. The human body is capable of clearing the infection. 70% of cases clear within one year. 90% within two. Of the remaining 10%, about half will experience cervical cancer within 10-15 years. PAP tests are used to detect pre-cancerous cells. Cervical cancer is treatable.

<strong>What is Gardasil?</strong>

<a href="http://www.gardasil.com/">Gardasil</a> is a vaccine that protects users from four of the many strains of HPV. These strains are responsible for about 70-75% of cervical cancer (depending on which source you cite). Seventy percent sounds like a big number so it's important to look at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cervical.htm">risk</a> of cervical cancer more closely. About 8 in 100,000 women experience cervical cancer each year. There are 1.9-3.7 deaths per year per 100,000 women as a result. One death is too many and every effort should be made to prevent these deaths, but questions need to be asked in terms of the efficacy of Gardasil and the risk to each vaccinated user before a final decision should be made for each individual.

<strong>What are the risks of Gardisil?</strong>

The C<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm?s_cid=mm6229a4_w">enter for Disease Control</a> and the World Health Organization stands by its opinion that the drug is safe for use. Their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm?s_cid=mm6229a4_w">reports</a> state that between June 2006 and March 2013,  21,194 recievers of the vaccination reported adverse reactions. Most of these were considered "non-serious." Proponents of the vaccination state the the only weak link in the plan to eliminate cervical cancer is that <a href="http://acsh.org/2013/07/hpv-vaccines-effective-but-vaccination-rates-still-low/">"doctors are failing to encourage their patients to recieve the vaccination."</a> The question must be asked: why?

Many credible American <a href="http://pop.org/content/merck-researcher-admits-gardasil-guards-against-almost-nothing-985">groups</a> have made public statements that the drug is dangerous. Reports of adverse reactions range from dizziness and headaches to seizures. The country of <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041099_Gardasil_side_effect_Japan_infertility.html">Japan</a> has withdrawn its support of the drug. While it will not pull the vaccination, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare no longer recommends the drug and those who receive it must be made well aware of the high risk of adverse reactions. In Japan, there are 1,968 cases that the ministry labels adverse and many are labeled as "severe" including "long term pain and numbness and infertility and paralysis." In August 2013, the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041512_Gardasil_ovary_destruction_HPV_vaccine.html">Australian</a> equivalent of the FDA concluded that the maker of Gardasil did not adequately test the impact of the drug on the reproductive system of women. A report in the <a href="http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2012/bcr-2012-006879.abstract">British Medical Journal</a> reported pre-mature ovarian failure in a sixteen-year-old as a result of the vaccination.

<strong>What Should I Do?</strong>
You should talk to your daughter early and thoroughly about the risk of sex outside of marriage. And before she is sexually active, she needs to consider with you whether or not her behavior puts herself and others at risk of sexually transmitted disease. This decision is not an easy one.

While our mission is the same: to bring the hearts of moms and daughters closer to each other and to Jesus, our content in the Crazy Hair Tour is all-new. I'm happy to share a few critical differences with you, but first let me assure you that our mission is being accomplished. One mom wrote in this week to tell us how much she loved the new event and wrote this: "I asked my daughter her favorite thing about the show. Her response: “I don’t know, it was all fun. I guess that I feel closer to you now. I don’t know why, I just do.” My heart is beating right out of my chest with joy! Here are some other cool things you need to know about the new event:

<strong>1.) <a href="http://www.1girlnation.com/">1 Girl Nation</a> is currently touring with us.</strong> This new group of five twenty-somethings who love Jesus "like crazy" (and have a song to prove it) are fantastic role models with some serious pipes. Disillusioned with Miley? Throw her music out. You won't need it after your daughter meets Kayli, Lauryn Taylor, Lindsey, Kelsey, and Carmen. <strong><em>We have integrated them right into the event, but you'll want to come half an hour early to hear their pre-show concert.</em></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1GN.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3395" alt="1GN" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1GN-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2.) The new theme encourages girls to denounce being normal (read: boy-crazy, obsessed with beauty, mean girls, etc) and embrace the idea of being totally God-crazy.</strong> My heart has been so burdened with the growing pressure for our little girls to grow up too fast and to follow the empty-headed crowd. If they do, the role models they feast upon with be Miley Cyrus and the behavior will have them looking like they are seventeen when they are seven. Someone had to sound an alarm, inviting them to stick out for Jesus. As I prayed, I remembered a verse that my dear friend and board member Laurel Mench handed me once. I have treasured it in my Bible since she gave it to me. II Corinthians 5:13-21 reads "If I acted crazy, I did it for God...Christ's love has moved me to such extremes. his love has the first and last word in everything we do." It became an anthem for our team as we developed the script for the Crazy Hair Tour. The teaching surrounding this verse is meaty. And your daughters will memorize it by the end of the night. That was very important to us as we prayed. We hope they go on to internalize this truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BibleMemory.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3397 aligncenter" alt="BibleMemory" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BibleMemory-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3.) All-new stories and lessons featuring a fan favorite from the start: <em>The Chicken Who Wanted To Be A Peacock.</em></strong> Even this story, based on a true story about Napoleon the Peacock who lives on my farm, calls girls out to be crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peacock.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3398 aligncenter" alt="Peacock" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peacock-300x156.jpg" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5.) The It's Sew Crazy Fashion Show is new and different.</strong> Get your needle and thread out and get ready for the It's SEW Crazy Fashion Show. Each outfit was modified using a simple mother/daughter sewing project. We will be posting those crafts here in September and October so you have a fun project to complete when you get home. (If ya want!) The outfit below was created using iron on decals. (Can you say "simple?") And that's my precious niece Rebecca in the photo!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3401 aligncenter" alt="543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4.) And, of course, there's lots of crazy hair!</strong> A favorite part of the Pajama Party Tour was wearing fuzzy slippers and pjs. Leave them at home or you'll look...well, crazy. (So it could work, after all.) But you can certainly wear your crazy hair and many moms are saying this is the best part of the night. "My daughter and I had so much fun going to the store to pick up crazy things for our hair and spent a whole hour in the bathroom laughing before we left for the event. Thank you for that time," wrote one mom!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3399 aligncenter" alt="1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, whad'ya say? Get crazy with us and help us build an army of girls who are so God-crazy, that the boy crazy train drives right on past! Here's our upcoming <a href="http://purefreedom.org/tour/">tour schedule</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. I don't appear at the Secret Keeper Girl live events. I am still trying to raise my own precious girls. Though they are young adults, I can't be on the road as much as would be demanded. I sure hope I get to meet you someday as I do make frequent speaking engagements. You'll absolutely love my team.</p>' WHERE meta_id = 23557 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

Forty percent of girls starting their periods have never heard about it from their own parents. Can you imagine how frightening it could be to wake up with bloodstained sheets or be horrified in the school bathroom and not have a clue what it means?

Let's make sure you punctuate your daughter's period with lots of enthusiasm and excitement rather than silence! Here is how you can talk to her in the right time and with the right attitude:

<strong>Prepare for the Conversation Years in Advance</strong>

Yes, begin teaching Sex Ed 101. I started these lessons with Rob and Lexi when they were in pre-school by talking to them about flowers. "You see," I would tell them as we looked into a lily, "even flowers have a daddy part (the pistil) and a mommy part (the stamen)." God created everything to make life. Even flowers! Get started as soon as you can with these simple life lessons and they will come much more naturally. Your willingness to talk openly about such topic ensures that your children will be able to come to YOU for answers.

<strong>Watch for the First Sign of Puberty</strong>

Your daughter's first period is the onset of puberty! There is something that happens one or two years before that. It's the sign to look for. Do you know what that is? Hint: She's got two and so do you! There ya go - you've got it! Breast buds.

&nbsp;

Your daughter's first period is <em>not</em> the onset of puberty! There is something that happens one or two years before that. It's the sign to look for. Do you know what that is? Hint: She's got two and so do you! There ya go - you've got it! Breast buds.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stages-puberty-female.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-6799"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6799 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stages-puberty-female-300x159.jpg" alt="stages puberty female" width="300" height="159" /></a>Medical journals say that the average girl experiences the first sign of breast buds at 10.7 years, give or take a little. Every girl develops at her own pace, so be prepared for anything. About 15% of girls experience both breast buds and pubic hair before eight years old, which means they are probably set to menstruate between their ninth and tenth birthday. Even if you are surprised at how soon it happens, <em>she </em>shouldn't be!

<strong>Tell Her About Her Period Between Her Eighth and Tenth Birthdays</strong>

The average age at which a girl has her first period is 12.7 years. This age can deviate by as much as a year and a half. So be prepared to talk to her no later than age nine. Here are two things you can do to make it easy to talk to her about.... "happy week"!

1. Tell her by using pictures of life.

Many moms talk about the basic function of periods, but fail to talk about <em>why</em> we have them. Having a period is God's great sign that he's preparing your daughter to be a mom one day! Here is where you have the wonderful opportunity to use your daughter's entrance into womanhood as a value-formation tool on the wonder of being a mom. <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-in-utero-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-6802"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6802 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-in-utero-2-300x225.jpg" alt="baby-in-utero-2" width="300" height="225" /></a>This transition is so critical for our daughters in this day and age. The feminine quality of motherhood has been under attack, and our daughters are losing. In a 2007 survey over over 1200 Christian teens, the vast majority of them did not want to be mothers and felt motherhood should be a goal secondary to the dreams they had for a career. How sad!

Start with the pictures and then accompany them with any of your specific thoughts about carrying your daughter in your womb, if you had that honor. Read Psalm 139 with your daughter during this time of conversation. This chapter gives you the wonderful opportunity to begin a dialogue to form your daughter's values about <em>true beauty</em> and the value of <em>motherhood</em>.

2. Give her a gift basket with all the necessary supplies. <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/periodpackswtamponsandchoc.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2147 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/periodpackswtamponsandchoc-233x300.jpg" alt="periodpackswtamponsandchoc" width="233" height="300" /></a>

Purchase or put together a <a href="http://www.periodpacks.com/gifts/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=1">cute basket</a> and stuff it full of girl things such as: a new bra, mini-pads, regular pads, teen-formula pain pills, body spray,  books, chocolate, Thermacare menstrual heat wraps, and a letter welcoming her to womanhood.  Also consider including a small zippered canvas or fabric bag that's filled with the basics so she can discreetly take it to school. She might think you are "making a big deal about it," but I guarantee you, she would much rather you celebrate with her and give gifts than her be alone in the bathroom stall at school!

Along with the basket should come a mini-lesson on how to use it all. And, if anyone should happen to twirl a tampon or stick a pad to their forehead, just take a deep breath and laugh!

What do you do, though, when she does start needing one? Let's be realistic. A nine-year-old doesn't need padding. But it can be tricky to find something appropriate for the little girl that you want her to stay, and you busy moms don’t have the time to drag her into every store at the mall.

Summer is quickly approaching and that means the dreaded swimsuit shopping adventure. Let’s just face it. Swimsuits are not modest, period. Nothing about them is. But if you’re going to the beeaaaach (sung to the tune of “rolling in the deep”) this summer, keep these Secret Keeper Girl tips in mind.
<ul>
	<li>Swimwear is for SWIMMING. Swimsuits are fine for jumping in the ocean or pool, but a Secret Keeper Girl covers up when she gets out. “Laying out” may be okay with girlfriends, but not when there are guys around. Whether it’s a pair of board shorts and T-shirt or a fun frilly cover-up, your girls have lots of adorable options!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Focus on what they CAN purchase. Do a bit of online perusing and show your girls some suits you think are modest. We’re partial to tankinis, especially ones with shorts (they’re usually less form-fitting than a one-piece; we’ve had success at places like Kohl’s and some sporting goods stores since athletic suits tends to cover more territory). Set the standard by showing them that modest swimwear can be cute. When you are teaching your girls about modesty, it’s crucial to show them what you can say “yes” to, or all they hear is “no” and that can crush their spirits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Discuss your expectations BEFORE you hit the mall. What mom says goes. As a general rule, we see NO reason for sheer fabric, bikinis, plunging necklines, or high-cut hips. (Of course, sharing an embarrassing moment to prove your point always adds some credibility!</li>
</ul>
And of course, don’t forget to finish off the trip by picking up some super-cool nail polish and stopping in for some refreshing summer smoothies.

For more modesty boosting ideas as we head into the warmer months, <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/tour/">come to the Secret Keeper Girl Crazy Hair Show</a> where we discuss our Truth or Bare Fashion Tests during our LIVE fashion show! You seriously won't want to miss!

This one is so simple, that it's a great recipe to teach your daughter measuring and mixing. It makes for some really fun mother/daughter kitchen time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Lemon Moon Cookies</strong>

1 box lemon cake mix

2 cups Cool Whip topping

1 egg, beaten

2 T. lemon juice

Mix all of the above ingredients together. The mixture will be like a sticky pizza dough though not stretchy. Take a teaspoon full of batter and drop it into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Then, put the sugar dipped drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 11 minutes. Let cool before letting them melt in your mouth!

It can print as a one-sided piece. Or you can opt to download a backside and then the piece can be folded to 8.5' x 5.5' and tabbed for direct mailing.

They are presented two per 8.5x11 sheet and can be laser printed. You may use our full color or black and white option. If you print in black and white we recommend hot pink paper! Our designers and printers have stated that this quality should work whether you print on a laser printer or whether you take it to a commercial printer. Enjoy the ease!

Originally, Secret Keeper was a book for teen girls about how to keep the deepest secrets of your beauty for just one man. It was very successful and we chose to use that name to approach teens in an age appropriate way about issues of modesty and purity. It is certainly not our intent to encourage girls to be secretive. You'll see our events and resources are a way to get moms and girls talking, talking, talking about everything!

Our popular books and events help moms cultivate God-crazy daughters who embrace inner beauty and biblical truths. Secret Keeper Girl live events bring mothers and daughters are filled with fun activities, dance parties, fashion shows and more - while saving time and space for important conversations that bring them closer to each other and Christ!

<div id="aboutIntro">

The Secret Keeper Girl Truth or Bare Fashion Tests were developed as a fun way for a girl and her mom to think about what she's wearing and monitor outfits for modesty. Often, cut-and-dry rules such as, <strong>"Your skirt should be two inches below the knee"</strong> and  <strong>"Your shorts need to come to the tips of your fingers"</strong>  are not always effective simply because each girl's body is unique! These tests have different results for every body type, age, and mind. We hope the suggested Truth or Bare guidelines help a girl think for herself as she comes to recognize the types of clothing that are modest - specific to her own body and fashion sense!

<h2>Test #1: Spring Valley</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> "Is my shirt too tight?"

<strong>Action:</strong> Take the tips of your fingers and press into your shirt, right where your ribs come together in the "valley" in the middle of your chest. When you take your fingers away, does your shirt immediately spring back like a small Smurf trampoline? If so, your shirt is too tight!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Try a different bra, since sometimes that can make a difference. But if it's still too tight get rid of that shirt. Buy your shirts based on fit, not size, because sizes can differ from brand to brand.</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Am I showing too much belly?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Stand up straight and raise both arms high in the air, like you are pointing up to Heaven. Is this exposing any belly? If so, your mom has permission to poke it!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Visit the men’s or boy’s department and buy a simple ribbed tank top (they often come in packages of three) to wear under your funky short T’s and crop tops or with your trendy low-riding jeans. Layering is an easy way to solve the belly problem!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Can you see my underpants”

<strong>Action:</strong> Bend over and touch your knees. Have your mom or a girl friend look at your bottom. Can she see the outline of your underpants? Can she see what color they are? How about your actual underwear because your pants are so low that you’re risking pulling a “plumber” exposure?

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> If your pants are so tight that you can see the outline of your panties, try buying pants one size larger! Wear flesh-tone panties with white or very light pants.</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “How short is too short?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Get in front of a full-length mirror. If you are wearing shorts, sit down criss-cross applesauce. If you’re in a skirt, sit in a chair with your legs crossed, applesauce. If you’re in a skirt, sit in a chair with your legs crossed, ladylike. Now, what do you see in the mirror? If you see undies, or lots of thigh, your shorts or skirt is too short!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Buy longer shorts and skirts! We know that due to today’s fashions, these can sometimes be hard to find. Fix the length problem by adding a pair of funky, bright-colored tights under your shorts and too-short skirts!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #5: The Plumbers Test</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Are my pants too low?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Sit cross-legged on the floor and bend over as if you are about to devour a great magazine. Now reach behind you and feel what might be the featured view if your pants are too low. (Or get your mom or a girlfriend to take a look!)

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> This is usually an easy fix with the Secret Weapon: a men’s tank or T-shirt, but be willing to consider that some low riders are just too low. Find a pair that won’t cause viewers to blush!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #6: Bra-lliant Idea</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is it cold in here?”

<strong>Action:</strong> When we get cold or nervous we tend to “get nippy”… if you catch my drift. When this happens, it is visible to others if our bras are not thick enough. There is no real test for this one (at least not one that I would want to take!)

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> When you are wearing thinner shirts, wear a thicker bra. When you are wearing a sweater or thicker shirt, go for the thin and cute bra if you want!</em>

<h2 data-fontsize="50" data-lineheight="75">Test #7: Stand in the Gap</h2>
<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is my button-down shirt too tight?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Button down your shirt and stand sideways looking in the mirror. If any of the spaces between the buttons is gaping open, even just a little, you’re in danger of exposing way too much, and in danger of losing a button!

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Try buying a size or two larger (if that number on the tag bothers you, just cut out the tag when you get home!) Or, try wearing a shirt under your button down and leave it unbuttoned for a layered look. Modesty is not just about how much of your beautiful epidermis is showing, but how much of your shape is showing!</em>

<strong>Target Question:</strong> “Is my shirt too low?”

<strong>Action:</strong> Take your hand and put your thumb in that little shelf under your neck (I have no idea what it is called, Collarbone maybe? Just feel around, you’ll find it.) Is there any skin showing below your hand? If so, you seriously need to rethink this shirt.

<em><strong>Remedy:</strong> Our Secret Weapon (the T-Shirt or tank) works for low shirts as well as short shirts! You can also go for a trendy layered look by putting a button down under a polo or rugby shirt that plunges too low.</em>[/fusion_text][/three_fourth][one_fourth last="yes" spacing="yes" center_content="no" hide_on_mobile="no" background_color="" background_image="" background_repeat="no-repeat" background_position="left top" hover_type="none" link="" border_position="all" border_size="0px" border_color="" border_style="" padding="" margin_top="" margin_bottom="" animation_type="" animation_direction="" animation_speed="0.1" animation_offset="" class="" id=""][imageframe lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" style_type="none" hover_type="none" bordercolor="#29b4c6" bordersize="5px" borderradius="round" stylecolor="" align="none" link="" linktarget="_self" animation_type="zoom" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.8" animation_offset="" hide_on_mobile="no" class="" id=""] <img src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/palm-pilot.jpg" alt="" />[/imageframe][/one_fourth][/fullwidth]' WHERE meta_id = 22615 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

This gift also reaches these girls at a critical time. <strong>90% of kids in America </strong>will form their <em>lifelong</em> values and beliefs... their FAITH... by their 13th birthday. Just 13!

Surrounded by young girls becoming “physically” active by age 11, a high rate of “physical” abuse, and excessive immodesty Danet Panton-Fuller sensed great risk for her precious daughters: Zariah, Andazi, and Azariah. She wanted desperately for them to rise above the statistics of The Projects.
<div class="g2glarge">

<strong>Moms and daughters living in these poverty pockets are not able to purchase Secret Keeper Girl event tickets or books and resources to use as tools to reduce these risks. We feel called to find a way to bring them to them at no cost.</strong>

</div>
Having never met Danet, God’s Spirit spoke to me about this for the first time in 2011 and called us to do a free event in the Bronx and to give the moms who attended free books to help them disciple their girls in true beauty, modesty and purity.  Today, Danet’s daughters are passionately seeking God’s best for their life as they find their joy and strength in Jesus.

We are looking forward to writing more great stories like this one as we reach out to poverty-stricken regions all across the US. This year we are headed to poverty pockets in Belle Glade, FL, East Liverpool, OH, and Richmond, VA.

Pray it forward and gift your memorable SKG experience to others.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret Keeper Girl is the most fun a mom and daughter will have digging into God's word together! In a world where culture is targeting young girls with the pressures of growing up too fast, Secret Keeper Girl is a ministry dedicated to enabling moms to connect to their daughters and raise a generation of girls who love Jesus, know their value, and are ready to navigate culture with those things in mind. Secret Keeper Girl resources and live events are filled with fun activities, dance parties, fashion shows and more – all aimed at getting moms and daughters talking about Christ-centered definitions of true beauty and modesty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2002, Dannah Gresh wrote "Secret Keeper: The Delicate Power of Modesty." It soon became a handbook for the modesty movement across the nation, encouraging teen girls to keep the deepest secrets of their beauty for one man. But while raising her own daughter, Dannah realized that in today's culture TWEEN girls are being targeted with pressures that their mom's didn't face until high school.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wanting to keep her little girl from growing up too fast, she knew that she needed to instill the values of true beauty and modesty before those teen years. Mascara, spaghetti straps, training bras, and all the other danger zones of being a girl: Dannah gathered her daughter and her friends together for a Christ-centered, tween-friendly study on the topic of what it means to be a godly girl. This was the start of Secret Keeper Girl.</span></p>
<p class="p1">And as it turns out, a lot of moms are seeing their daughters face the pressure of growing up too fast! Since starting Secret Keeper Girl, Dannah Gresh has released more than 25 books for moms and their tweens, and Secret Keeper Girl live events have helped over 200,000 moms and daughters begin conversation about the deepest secrets of their beauty and value. Secret Keeper Girl has become the nation's number one tool for connecting moms and their tween daughters to each other and to Christ.</p>

<strong>FACT #1: Our brain is called MasterTour.</strong> Coordinating up to 50 tour stops in three months with a tour team of up to 12 and an off-road management team of only 4 takes a brain. And we have one. It's called MasterTour.

Only He knew that the gracious owner of that RV would later offer to buy us a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/08txi9of5r2k274/AABBc0kHmqTQdfHKT_M6hmYxa?dl=0">BRAND-NEW BUS</a>! <img class="size-medium wp-image-6298 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4902-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4902" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the start of the Spring 2015 tour season, we were rolling with style in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/08txi9of5r2k274/AABBc0kHmqTQdfHKT_M6hmYxa?dl=0">beautiful gift of a bus we decided to name Providence so we always remember the Lord's hand in giving it to us</a>. The bus is our home-away-from-home and this new one is spacious and was newly renovated inside so it is super comfy! Stephanie, our wonderful bus driver, drives the team from city to city while they sleep in one of the 12 bunks onboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">**Be sure to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secretkeepergirl">follow us on Facebook</a> because on our days off, we love to have friends like YOU come and hang out with us on the bus!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #3: We blow up a lot of balloons each morning.</strong> Each event requires stage set up that takes us about 3 hours. No one gets the morning off. We all help set up lighting, sound equipment, staging pipe and drape, the resource table signs and banners, books, and lots and lots of balloons. The balloon sculptures for the stage take about an hour and require several volunteers from our host church (whom we love so much) managed by one team member who handles our 7' crazy hair column topper with expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons.png"><img class=" wp-image-4762 alignleft" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons-300x252.png" alt="Balloons" width="240" height="202" /></a>
<em>Last year we spent about 80 hours blowing up 17,760 balloons.</em></p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #5: We manage a lot of clothes and props backstage.</strong> From the world's largest chicken egg to a complete set of authentic vintage clothing from four different decades, our stage team manages all of its own props. We put them out in the morning and do a careful accounting of each item at the end of each night. Heather (vintage clothing coordinator) and Jordan ("It's Sew Crazy" tween fashion show designer) are seen below organizing one of our wardrobes from a former season.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4766 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n-300x225.jpg" alt="312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Crazy Hair Tour uses 111 props each night including the world's largest sling shot! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #6: Every day we do a sound check.</strong> The last thing we do before daily team devos and lunch is our sound check. We're usually excited by this point because it means we're almost to the part of the day that we get "off." From about noon to four we get to hang out in our bus home or get a shower in a local hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6865.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6301 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6865-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_6865" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The worship team having way too much fun during sound check! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #7: We eat at midnight.</strong> They say that being on stage for one hour is the equivalent of a 4 hour workout. Since we're on stage for nearly three hours, we are starving by the time the bus is loaded up and our pjs (comprised of sweat pants and sweat shirts) are on. We have been known to eat burgers the size of our heads (Lexi) and pizza no less worth talking about (Suzy) at midnight which is when we roll on out of one city and head to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger.png"><img class=" wp-image-4768 alignleft" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger-294x300.png" alt="Burger" width="283" height="288" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year our food budget was $11,799. (We eat less than the bus, that's for sure!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After our midnight snack, it's off to bed in our trusty tour bus. And on to the next city to do it all over again! Can't wait to see YOU this tour season!! ❤</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/crazyhair.php">Secret Keeper Girl stage team</a> recently had the awesome opportunity to join a group of mothers and daughters who are going through an ‘</span><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/search?q=8+great+dates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8 Great Dates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ book. The topic of the week - MEAN GIRLS. After introductions were made, the group discussion things progressed slowly as everyone was unsure of how honest and open they could be. But as our hearts opened up and the conversation picked up steam, we all learned three very important lessons from each other about friendship and mean girls.</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     1. We use the phrase “mean girls” all of the time, but could our frequent use of the term be causing us to miss other potentially toxic friendships that are all along the spectrum? Take the SKG team for example - to break the ice, each girl shared about her friendship experiences. Starting at the beginning of the line, we had the bully, who said mean things and acted in unkind ways while growing up. To her right was the girl who was neither a mean girl nor a bully; she just kind of got along with everyone. Up next was the girl who had been hurt by bullies. When she was growing up, she had all types of mean things said to her and didn’t have good friend. Lastly there was one more girl, who had a unique experience that isn’t often discussed. When she was younger, she found herself in a friendship she <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thought</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was good but really wasn’t. She was very young and so confused that even when she found herself lying to her mother about this girl, it didn’t register that the friendship wasn’t the best thing for her. Even though her friend wasn’t being a stereotypical “mean girl”, she certainly wasn’t being a good friend. All this to say, it’s important to focus on what makes a good friend and what doesn’t and not just “mean girls”.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">     2. Most of us are quite familiar with the quote “before you judge me, walk a mile in my shoes,” but how often do we teach our daughters to really do this? As our group talked, the girl who was was a bully shared that her meanness stemmed from having to experience a death in her family at a very young age. Another mom shared that her daughter had dealt with a bully and over time, it came out that the mean girl had a lot of difficulties in her life. Now please don’t think we’re saying that meanness is ok if someone has a sad enough excuse. No, those who are mean still have to take responsibility for their actions. What we're saying is that <em>a lot </em>of times, there is pain behind the meanness. Which leads us to say this... </span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     3. ‘Be holy’ (1 Peter 1:16)… Oh man, this is so good to talk about and it’s “easy” to do when things are great and you’re in the midst of a good friendship group. But what about when you’re the one being bullied at school? What about when it’s your feelings that are being hurt and it’s you or your daughter who comes home crying? What about when things get so bad that you or your child doesn’t even want to go to school? Yeah, that’s when the command to be holy as our Father is holy is like ‘really, Jesus? You ask way too much!’</span></li>
</ol>
Guess what? He DOES ask too much! But He never asks it without promising to help us by doing whatever He’s asking us to do <i>THROUGH </i>us! Loving your bully, praying for them, forgiving them is NOT easy and you know why? Because it’s NOT natural! It’s not normal. It’s supernatural. It’s CRAZY, something that <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/crazyhair.php">we are all about here at Secret Keeper Girl</a>! And it’s something that can ONLY be done with supernatural help and with through the Holy Spirit’s working in our hearts and minds. In friendships, holiness can take on many different forms; it all depends on what the Spirit is leading you to do, which is why it’s imperative to seek His face in times like these. Holiness could mean distancing yourself. The Bible says “make <em>every effort</em> to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.” (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>, NIV)  Sometimes to keep the peace, you need to distance yourself a la Lot and Abraham in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013">Genesis 13</a>. Holiness could also mean the Spirit leading you or your daughter to trying to befriend whoever is causing you trouble. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a> says “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you…” (KJV) It is so not <span style="font-weight: 400;">normal to “love", "bless", "do good to" or "pray for" </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone who is making your life hard, but by doing these things the Lord could soften the hearts of your bully, give you an opportunity to make a good friend, and maybe even lead them to Himself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a good friend and being involved in good friendships can happen in a myriad of ways. The bottom line </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be found in the latter part of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>. It’s written above. Did you catch it? “<em>...Without holiness no one will see the Lord</em>.” This is what life is all about for the believer - living in such a way so that people are seeing the Lord, people are seeing Jesus. It’s important to realize and remember that <strong>as Christ-followers </strong></span><strong><i>everything</i> about us, even our friendships, should simply be ways in which the world can <i>SEE JESUS</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Make efforts towards peace for Jesus. Be a good friend for Jesus. Love your bullies for Jesus. It’s not about us and it is all about Him.</span>

You hear names like Jacob and David more often than Jessica and Emily in after-school conversations? Is this a good thing, bad thing or is she just a tomboy?

Early dating relationships, teen sex without consequences and a constant diet of boy-crazines is marketed to our daughters through movies, television shows, books, music and advertising. You and I have to be countercultural if we are going to protect our little girls and teach them to approach guy-girl relationships in a holy and age-appropriate manner!

It is not innaproraite or uncommon for your daughter to have multiple guy friends; especially if she is a bit more "rough and tumble," preferring a ball to a ballet slipper! Mom, even as adults we can admit that guys are not as caddy, they don't hold grudges and just roll with the punches. Your daughter is befriending them for the same reasons you did!

Well monitored, co-ed play dates are certainly appropriate and can be beneficial to your daughter. But, somewhere between the ages of 8-12 something shifts. She goes from having a guy pal to wanting a boyfriend. Some might think it's cute for girls to have multiple <em>boyfriends</em> while they are in the 5th grade. However, if your daughter develops the pattern of "needing" a guy when she's eight or nine, she could be heading for multiple long-term relationships in her teen years. That's not wise. Let's help her stay off the boy-crazy train!

You can do this by carefully monitoring her friendships with boys. Listen closely as she talks about her guy friends and the fun they have together. When her heart begins to shift - and you will see it - that may be the time to redefine her friendships with boys. By no means does this include writing them off! It may just mean they don't need to be alone together to play video games. Rather than hanging out in your basement alone, you can send them with a group of friends to the park. Encourage friendships with girls who have similar interests.

Encourage your daughter's father and other men in her life to step up to be the ones she throws the ball with! Countless studies have proven that the more involved a father figure is, the less likely she is to engage in early dating relationships and sexual activity. Admonish Dad, Brother, Uncle, etc. to take her on a hike or bike ride, go fishing, play ball, attend a sporting event or fancy dinner.

Remain in close communication with your daughter about all of her friendships, especially those with boys. Ask her how she feels about herself, boys, and relationships. Then you get to respond to those emotions and direct them with more questions. Pray with your daughter for any guys in her life she considers her friend. Ask that God help her approach those relationships in ways that honor Him.

By the time a girl is eleven, 30% of her peers will have had a boyfriend. Since this drive to be in a relationship only escalates, it's important to talk to your daughter before it happens. If she is already at the "boyfriend" phase, read our <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/featured/how-do-i-talk-to-my-daughter-about-dating/">blog</a> on how to talk to her about dating.'

So many dresses today give off the not-so-little girl vibe. We want a look for our girls that says <em>sweet</em> and <em>innocent</em> rather than <em>growing up too fast</em>. However, many dresses that are little girl appropriate are often lack-luster when it comes to style.

Want to add some color to your dress? How about some bling? Adding simple embellishments can take your dress from dull to designer in a matter of minutes!

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_7744.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3494 aligncenter" alt="IMG_7744" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_7744-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Does your girl love rhinestones, sequins and bling? Help your daughter sew some along the hem of her dress or along the neckline for a touch of fancy. Is she funky and expressive? Let her pick out some themed buttons for a unique style spin.

This grey dress appears in the Secret Keeper Girl Crazy Hair Tour It's Sew Crazy Fashion Show. We felt it was a bit drab on its own so we added a collar of buttons!

It’s a BIG deal to be a girl! It’s a big deal to be a boy and that’s pretty cool, huh? Which leads up to number 2!</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. God created us male and </span><b><i>female</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reflect His image. (vs 27)
</span>The absolute best part of God’s design was Adam and Eve, man and woman. You may be wondering why God chose two different biological sexes to represent Him? How does being a boy or a girl help us reflect God’s image? That’s a big question so does everyone have their thinking caps on? Let’s dive in!
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that God is actually three distinctly different persons in one? Do you know Who they are? Yes, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, which is why He’s known as the trinity (“tri” means 3, incase you didn’t know, so He is 3 in 1.) The Hebrew word in the Bible for this unity of the trinity is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This word refers to marriage, when a man and a woman coming together in union reflects how God comes together in the trinity. Genesis 2:24 says that a man and a woman will become one (echad) flesh. A man and a woman are two distinctly different, independent humans, but when they come together, they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just like God the trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">echad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is heavy-duty brain food, but we think that you’re capable of handling it all!! ?</span></li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Looking like God is a </span><b><i>process</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (2 Corinthians 3:18)
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This verse says that we are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transformed to look more like God. We don’t come out already looking like God. It’s not just because you were born a girl that you look like God. And it’s not just once you get married that you’ll </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like God. We are still being made to look more and more like God as we follow Jesus. He started with the fact that you are a girl, and He continues working in your heart to reflect Him every day. Does anyone out there think that they are completely perfect in every single itty bitty way? No, none of us are perfect! We don’t look exactly like God because we’re human and humans have sin, but every day that we follow Jesus and learn more about how to be like Him, we become a better and better reflection of Him.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You start to look more and more like Jesus through praying, and studying His Word, by doing what He says, and by loving him in your heart. Being a girl is a GREAT reflection of Him. But don’t stop there! Be loving, and kind, and obedient. Sometimes this means cleaning your room when you would really just rather be watching TV, or choosing to be nice to someone at school who wasn’t nice to you. Reflect God well by being a GIRL who wants to be like JESUS.</span>
<blockquote>Prayer Time: <span style="font-weight: 400;">In what way(s) are you struggling to look like Jesus? Maybe it’s obeying your parents, or being nice at school. Maybe it’s lying or cheating on a test. Maybe it’s not trying to be like Jesus, or telling teeny tiny lies that you think you can get away with. Daughters, tell your moms the top #1 way that you struggle to be a reflection of God. Then, moms, take a minute to pray over your girls.</span>

Monthly Challenge: This assignment is all about making your girl’s heart beautiful aka making it more like Jesus'. This month I want you to celebrate being a girl with your daughter and her closest friends by doing our FREE mother-daughter Spring date.

If you joined us at the Secret Keeper Girl ‘Crazy Hair Tour’ you would remember the sound of 100’s of sweet little girls singing “Jesus Loves Me” with one voice as some made a first time commitment to Christ.

Since 2010, over 5,256 girls at Secret Keeper Girl events have come forward with their moms to commit their lives to Christ. [1] On average, a girl comes to Christ every 9 hours through Secret Keeper Girl. Every girl has a story. All of them precious-- just like this one.
<blockquote>Today my daughter had a bad day at school and then took the bad home with her to her sister and me. She cried and broke down. I... wanted to cry and break down! We decided to squeeze in Secret Keeper Girl tonight at the last minute. She mumbled on the way, "Today is the WORST day ever!" However, tonight at SKG, God led me to share the gospel with my daughter again. But this time was different! She got into the car and exclaimed, "This time I felt Him! Jesus is in my heart! Tomorrow's going to better because I have Jesus to help me!" As we drove home, she exclaimed, "This is the BEST day ever!” God has a way to make bad always turn to good! She cried! I cried! Today was the BEST day ever with my tween!</blockquote>
The reality is that nearly half of all Americans who accept Jesus Christ as their Savior do so before reaching the age of 13. What these girls “believe by their thirteenth birthday is generally what they will die believing” (Barna Research). [2] That’s why I’m so passionate to reach them before they conform to the new “normal” for 10 year-olds -- - push-up bras, sexy dolls, and mascara sales.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/frostine.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-7266"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7266 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/frostine-300x169.jpg" alt="frostine" width="300" height="169" /></a>The early sexualization of our little girls is totally out of control. For example, the average age of an eating disorder clinic patient has dropped from 15 to 10 and 66% of underweight girls think they’re fat. Even the toys you and I grew up with are getting sexy makeovers. Remember Princess Frostine from Candy Land? Well, look at her now.

&nbsp;

Research is clear that the greatest risk reducer for these girls is mother/daughter connectedness. Because of that, I’m excited to debut the all-new Secret Keeper Girl ‘<span style="color: #8600bb;">Purple Party Tour</span>’ on August 18th. The new show will be even more effective in equipping moms with proven tools to teach their girls the secrets of true beauty and biblical modesty and will cultivate more priceless moments between mom, daughter and Jesus.
<p style="text-align: left;">We’ll also teach girls a loving, biblical view of gender in a safe, age-appropriate manner. What could be more important during a summer when people are petitioning Disney to make Frozen’s beloved Elsa gay in an upcoming sequel? [3]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #8600bb;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Our work is crucial.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #8600bb;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Our “ask” is simple.</span></strong></span></p>
I really need your help to create opportunities for girls to hear truth at the Secret Keeper Girl ‘<span style="color: #8600bb;">Purple Party Tour</span>’. The cost of bringing a new show and curriculum to life is about $100,000. Our goal is to raise that by July 15th. Friends like you help girls experience pure freedom their whole lives as long as we teach them the secrets of true beauty and modesty.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>At nearly every event, people tell us, “If only this had been around when I was young I might not have known the hurts that I know.”</strong></h3>
Because of your faithfulness, Secret Keeper Girl has been there at the exact right time for more than 150,000 girls. Together, we can help them prevent the pain so many of us felt for far too long. I’m asking you to walk alongside us to reach even more moms and daughters with the message of Pure Freedom. Here are some specific ways to help.

Look any and just about everywhere and you will see a huge debate over how girls should be girls. Girl who are girly girls, tomboys, and those who are a fabulous mix of both, are often ridiculed by peers and society. There are a lot of opinions out there BUT what does God, the one who has the first and last say in everything actually have to say? We spent our last Girl Gab Bible Study diving into His Word because it has some pretty cool and important things to say about girls and why no matter if they .... they are all His masterpieces who reflect His glory.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have your daughter open her Bible to Genesis 1 and read verses 26-31. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1. You were created in God’s <i>image</i> and that’s very good! (vs 31)
</span>According to verse 31, you weren’t created in the image of your mother, father, or grandparents, regardless of whose nose you might spot on the front of your face. You were created in the image of GOD, and He says that is “very good”. It might be because we make God visible or known (we glorify Him) by looking like Him. We were created IN HIS IMAGE to GLORIFY Him. The Bible talks about a very specific way that we glorify Him, and it’s awesome. See, we have all kinds of talents and skills — from being able to play sports to singing well to being very good at art — but the best way for us represent the wonder of God and look like Him is through our roles as male and female. It’s a BIG deal to be a girl! It’s a big deal to be a boy and that’s pretty cool, huh? Which leads up to number 2!

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2. God created us male and <i>female</i> to reflect His image. (vs 27)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn on the television, scroll on any social media site, open any magazine and you’ll see it. You may even feel it. The pressure circulating females today is palpable. We are expected to look a certain way, dress a certain way, speak a certain way - it’s maddening! With all of these opposing and oftimes off-base opinions screaming, “come over this way and join us!”, it’s no wonder that your tween may feel a little odd at times as she struggles to find out who she is and why God created her the way she is. The confusion sometimes goes deep! From the ages of 9-16, I knew I was a female who was made in the image of God, and that I was a child of God because I’d accepted Jesus as my Savior. I loved being a girl but because I was taller than all of my class (boys included), more muscular than all my girlfriends, wasn’t dainty, and didn’t have a huge interest in “girly” things, I felt very out of place and confused about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to be </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a girl. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What about your tween daughter? Is she a glitz-loving girly girl? How about a football-chasing tomboy? Both of these groups may be ridiculed by their peers and society, but we want to talk about why God thinks BOTH (as well as all the girls in between) are awesome! Whether she prefers to run around with dirt under her fingernails or she loves to hit the nail salon with you or friends, her preference matters to God. Whether she prefers to play with dinosaurs and trucks over dolls and tea sets, there is something God can use in those separate interests. Whether she loves to play dress up like Princess Anna or like Batman, God wants to use that imagination for His glory and honor. Whether she dreams of being a marine biologist, a mother, the president, or a librarian, God has something special and unique for her to do that no one else can do! </span>

In a recent focus group, 76% of moms said their tween daughters struggle to obey authority while 97% of those daughters admitted they struggle to obey.  Virtually all of our tween girls are struggling to prize an attitude of respect in our “here’s a blue ribbon for showing up” and “you totally deserve that pricey frappuccino” culture.  Don’t get us wrong, we think being a strong girl is awesome! So during our last <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girlgab.php">SKG Girl Gab Mother/Daughter Bible study</a>, we looked at the story of Abigail to learn how to be BOTH strong and humble. It's Girl Power God's Way!

Have your daughter open her Bible to 1 Samuel 25 and read verses 1-13, 18-20, and 23-28.

	<li><strong>1. Jesus is the <em>King</em> of <em>Kings</em> and the Lord of Lords!</strong> (Revelation 19:16)
Now what does this have to do with being a daughter of the King? Well everything, really! Jesus is THE King. He's not just <em>a </em>king or one of many kings, but THE King. He's the number one ruler!</li>

	<li><strong>2. We are God’s <em>children</em>. He predestined us for <em>adoption</em>. Since Jesus is the King of Kings, and we are His adopted daughters, that makes us <em>princesses</em>. </strong>(Romans 8:15-17 and Ephesians 1:4-5)
If you have A. admitted that you are a sinner, have B. believed that only Jesus can save you from your sin [because He lived a perfect life, died in your place to pay the penalty for your sin, and rose again on the third day], and have C. confessed that Jesus is the King and that you want to be in His family, guess what? You ARE a Princess, daughter of the real-live King! Yes, this is awesome! You are a daughter of the King! But there's a catch.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>3. I am not <em>my own</em>.</strong>  (1 Corinthians 6:19)</li>
	<li>Remember if you're a daughter of the King, you get to belong to THE King! So yes, you are a Princess but you are not the one on the throne. Jesus is and we submit our lives to His authority. And we submit to the authority that God has placed over us. This is hard one but if we can't submit to the authority over our lives, we won't submit to Jesus either. Jesus placed us in families so that we can learn how to live out Ephesians 5:21, which says 'submit to one out of reverence to Christ'. And He know this is super hard but He has promised to help us with this!</li>

<blockquote>MONTHLY CHALLENGE - This is not easy so PRACTICE living as if your life is not your own. Choose a slot of time in which you are usually free to do whatever you want (maybe right after school or when your homework is completed). Instead of using that time to focus on yourself, use it to meet a need of someone in your home. Here are a few options (or choose your own):
1. Offer to cook dinner one evening. Encourage your parents to spend the time they would have spent cooking and cleaning doing something that helps them relax.
2. Take your younger brother or sister outside for some play time. Let them pick the game and they play until you’re both worn out. For extra credit, allow a friend of your brother or sister’s hang out too.
3. Spend 30 minutes in prayer for someone in need. Don’t use this prayer time to make requests for yourself. Concentrate your prayer efforts on the needs of someone else.</blockquote>

With programs like Toddlers and Tiaras and reality shows where sass and diva-ness is applauded and laughed at, it's no wonder that many struggle with raising daughters who aren't brats. Now you may be thinking, 'nope! That's not my little girl!' If that's true, awesome, but let's ask you a question - does your daughter act like no one can tell her what to do? Like she's in charge of her own life?

If the answer is yes, you're not alone. In one of our recent focus groups, 76% of moms said their tween daughters struggle to obey authority while 97% of those daughters admitted they struggle to obey. <span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">Virtually all of our tween girls are struggling to prize an </span>attitude of respect in our “here’s a blue ribbon for showing up” and “you totally deserve that pricey frappuccino” culture. Don’t get us wrong, we think being a strong girl is awesome! In fact, throughout the Bible God repeatedly uses super strong ladies to do super important things. Let’s take a look at the biblical example of Abigail and learn how to do girl power God’s way with both strength and respect.

Welcome to 2016, moms! With so many social media dangers and apps like Snapchat and Instagram, it’s so hard to know when/if your child should even have a phone and if she does, where is the line? Ah the great debate and while we hear you, we think the debate should go beyond should my child have a cell phone or not. If you decide to not give your child a phone, great! But if you do (that’s wonderful!), have you set your daughter up so she knows how to handle the device in a mature and healthy way?

Your daughter had to be taught how to properly tie and wear her shoes, right? Well in the same way, she must be taught how to use electronic devices in a mature and healthy way. Children can’t do what they haven’t been taught to do, so during our last SKG Girl Gab Mother/Daughter Bible study, we went "Online with Eve" to learn 5 truths about self-control your daughter needs to know so she can handle electronics wisely.

Have your daughter open her Bible to Genesis 3 and read verses 1-13 and 20-21.
<ol>
	<li><strong>1. Everything God made is <em>good</em></strong>. (Genesis 1:31)</li>
	<li>The tree of knowledge of good and evil that Eve and her husband, Adam, ate from was good because God created it and <em>everything</em> God has created is good. Think about all the things that make up cell phones or tablets or television screens. God created the brains that developed the internet. He made the materials that make up cell phones. He made the air and sound waves upon which radio and television pictures travel to our electronic devices. The internet, media, and electronics <em>can be </em>used for good things and maybe the thing that is tempting you is actually a good thing, which leads us to #2.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>2. </strong><strong>Satan is a <em>liar</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:1; John 8:34)</li>
	<li>Depending on what version of the Bible you're reading, Genesis 3:1 may say Satan was "crafty" which means, Satan is untruthful and sneaky. John 8:34 names Satan as the 'Father of All Lies,' meaning all lies come from him. So Satan will take something is good and has a good purpose and lie to us about its purpose so that we are tempted to do bad things with it. Satan twisted what God said and made Eve think that God was withholding something good from her. In the same way, Satan's lies can make us feel like we will miss out on something or like we won't be considered cool if we follow God's way.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><strong>3. </strong><strong>Eve had to make a decision to be <em>God-controlled</em> by being <em>self-controlled</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:4)</li>
	<li>Self-control is actually a fruit of the Spirit, meaning it comes from God. He gives us the ability to control ourselves so if we don't have God helping us, we can't have self-control. Eve had a decision to make - whether she was going to believe Satan, the liar, or believe God and use His help to control herself. We too have to decide whether we're going to let media and television control us or whether we're going to use God's help, His Spirit, to have control over us.</li>
	<li><strong>4. Giving into <em>temptation</em> always leads to a <em>situation</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:6-7)</li>
	<li>Temptation leads you to a place where instead of feeling good or comforted, you feel naked and ashamed like Eve did when God came to find her. But the good news is found in #5...</li>
	<li><strong>5. God will <em>comfort</em> you if you don’t keep <em>hiding</em></strong>. (Genesis 3:21)</li>
	<li>Adam and Eve had to come out and let God see them. Once they revealed themselves, God gave them fur coats (or garments of skins), which means He clothed them. He comforted them.</li>
</ol>
Girls and moms, we all face temptation, things that tease us into doing the wrong thing. But with God's help, we can all choose to be self-controlled. And when we mess up, when we give into temptation, we can also choose to come out of hiding. Daughters, if you're hiding something, if you've done something or looked at something you know you weren't supposed to, don't stay silent any longer. Come out! Tell God, tell your mom. They may give you consequences - which are really for your good -  but they will also give you comfort through their love and forgiveness.

Let's admit one thing: it's not unusual to want to be loved!

Every person on earth has a deep desire to be loved. While we girls may endure an especially pronounced craving for it, love is a basic need of humanity. Guys just don't tend to act as needy for us as we act for them. And that's where some of our woundedness begins. We think they can fix our hearts. They know they can't, so they get annoyed when we expect them to at least try.

Once during a difficult season of feeling unloved and craving violently for my husband to fix it, I cried out to God with the guttural pleading of the deeply wounded. In complete desperation, I began a journey of praying through my need, which led me to Proverbs 19:22, and I encourage you to start your own journey to true love with this same verse. It reads:
<blockquote>What a man desires is unfailing love;
better to be poor than a liar.
(Proverbs 19:22, NIV)</blockquote>
That verse was like a healing balm to my heart. It gave me permission to be love crazy! It said to me, "Dannah, let's just put it out there: everyone has a deep desire to be loved. Don't lie about it. Just say it like it is: I want to be loved!"

If you and your teen daughter have been to our Pure Freedom Teen Tour, you know all about our Love Feast. If you haven't, first - grab your teen girl (and any teen girls and their moms who you know) and come see us! Details are further down in this email. Second, let me explain the Love Feast. It's a ten day experience that we want your teen daughter to join...no guys, just God.

The salve for your daughter's deep craving will not be found in white-knuckling her way out of boy-craziness. It won't be found in legalistically "fasting from guys" without feeding her true need for love. It's not going to work for her to deny her deep and genuine desire. The best place for her to begin is to verbally spiritually express a deep truth: I need love!

You see, God alone holds the answer to our deep craving for love. He is our Source. Tell your daughter to give it a try. <strong>Let her be love crazy</strong>!

For your daughter to <a href="http://purefreedom.org/love-feast/">join our Love Feast</a>, she only needs to do two things.
She'll need to grab her copy of <em><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/get-lost-your-guide-to-finding-true-love">Get Lost</a></em>. If she doesn't have it, not to worry! We have a special <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/get-lost-book-t-shirt-gift-pack">February Love Feast Pack</a> just for her below.

She needs to <a href="http://purefreedom.org/love-feast/">register at this link</a>. Starting March 1, 2016 we'll keep in touch with her via email daily with direction and encouragement as she learns to feast on God's love.
We hope your girl will join us!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom, you send us emails all the time asking for advice. From questions about friends, siblings, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues with self-entitlement to boys and puberty, we’re happy we get to offer you biblically sound and practical help. We recently received the following email from an SKG mom and are wondering if this resonates with you: </span>
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend, our tween had a few girlfriends say over at our house - and they all stayed on their phones almost the entire time! Instead of simply playing games and engaging with each other, the entire night was documented with pictures and videos, all of which were immediately uploaded to Instagram. From then on, any dialogue was about whose picture or video received the most views and likes. Later, I overheard an Instagram video of a girl who, finding out about the get together online, was upset at not being invited to the party. I was totally speechless and taken by surprise! I mean, what ever happened to girls going to each other’s houses to chat, giggle, and play games?</span></i></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Whatever happened to that? Welcome to 2016, moms! With so many social media dangers and apps like Snapchat and Instagram, it's so hard to know when/if your child should even have a phone and if she does, where is the line? While we hear you, we think the debate should go beyond should my child have a cell phone or not. If you decide to not give your child a phone, great! But if you do (that's wonderful!), PLEASE make sure your instructions go beyond telling her how the functions work and when she can/can't use the phone.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Torres* family is an incredibly courageous group with deeply wounded hearts and the most basic of needs. The mother was widowed by the tragic suicide of her husband, whose body was discovered in their living room by his daughters [aged 16, 15, 13, 8, and 6]. To say that this left an emotional scar on their precious hearts is inaccurately miniaturized. This has set the family in a dark place of poverty and hopelessness. The children are in tears frequently as they face the daily hunger of poverty. This family is crying out for the most basic of needs – food, protection, love. (*Name has been changed)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This past fall, a very talented teen musician named Heather* started her first year as a drum major for the marching band. She was a fierce leader even before becoming drum major, standing out as the only girl on the drumline. She took full advantage of this position by befriending and inspiring other girls to get involved with music. Heather’s mom glowed with pride and supported her daughter by becoming very active with the other band parents. Her first year as a drum major should have been filled with joy, exciting challenges, and memory-makers, but these ‘should have been’s’ were confronted with a harsh reality early this year. Heather’s mom had already beaten breast cancer when Heather was just a baby, but tragically found out she had developed advanced throat cancer mere months before Heather stepped into her new role. Heather’s mom’s chemotherapy has kept her from watching her daughter march, and as the cancer ravages her body, the family is unsure of how much time she has left. They’re longing to make this year’s holiday season a memorable one. (*Names have been changed)</span>

On December 1, 2015 (#GivingTuesday), help us raise $10,000 <strong>and</strong> become one of 50 new Girl to Girl (G2G) members who will partner with us in ministry and help us reach more families like Heather’s with Jesus’ love.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica* and her 10 year old daughter, Rachel*, are an all-American military family and as such they have to be separated for long seasons of deployment and various military trainings. They have had to adjust and work at being flexible in ways that should never be asked of a mother and daughter. Thankfully, Rachel is blessed with loving family members who love to have her stay with them when her mother is away serving our country - but there is nothing quite like being cared for by your own mother. Unfortunately, Rachel has never met her father.  We want to send Rachel a #SKGPinkBox this Christmas to help her find a beautiful relationship with her Heavenly Father, and pursue His heart for purity and modesty. (*Names have been changed)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chloe* joined the surrounding tweens in laughter and music at a Secret Keeper Girl show just over a month ago.  While all of the the crazy fun and colorful balloons lifted her spirits, the glowing smile on her face faded as she lay in her hospital bed that night. Chloe is a beautiful 13 year old who lives at a hospital because she suffers from severe depression, anxiety, and extending physical ailments which have been complicated by an eating disorder. Looking on the outside one would never know the depth of Chloe’s distress, but on the inside her heart and soul are screaming in pain. Her father abandoned her and her mother when Chloe was just a baby. It’s an absence that has always been felt, but as Chloe ventures into her teenage years the lack of fatherly love and support is mighty. She struggles with hating herself for not being enough for her father to stay. Her mother does everything she can to support and provide for her, but steady employment has been hard to come by with her daughter in the hospital. Chloe’s mom has her own depth of physical and emotional pain to overcome, and she is doing her very best to be strong for her daughter. With the father’s lack of financial and emotional child support and their own minimal income, Chloe and her mother could use a practical gift of love. (*Names have been changed)</span>

The <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php" target="_blank">Secret Keeper Girl to Girl</a> fund exists to be able to hear a need and respond to it on the spot! Through your Girl to Girl donations, a myriad of cries from families and children have been heart and met. Here is a special story that is close to our hearts…

In June 2015, <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php" target="_blank">Secret Keeper Girl to Girl (G2G)</a> provided funding for life-saving medical treatment and transportation for a little boy in Haiti named Pierre. Without access to proper medical treatment, Pierre developed a life threatening medical condition that doctors are currently working to fully diagnose. His local doctors lacked access to necessary medical equipment and nutritional formulas for him but your generosity helped to deliver him into safe hands. He is still fighting malnourishment, dehydration, partial paralysis and uncontrollable movements of some limbs among other things but his condition is improving with proper medical attention and proper nutrition, and we are praising the Lord for his continued improvement.
<blockquote>
<h3>"Thanks to you, Dannah, and your entire team. You’re buying us time, and you’re buying his momma hope."
– Pastor who is facilitating Pierre’s treatment in Haiti</h3>
</blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year a very special <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> (G2G) partner named Julie inspired our hearts and did something that we will never forget.  As the single mother of a beautiful tween she realized the immense blessings God had bestowed upon her and decided to BE a blessing. She reached out to the <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> family on behalf of a single mom who had escaped an abusive relationship with her tween and was now living with her until she could get back on her feet. One of the biggest hurdles Julie faced was saving a storage facility that held all of her houseguest's belongings (school pictures, Christmas stockings, and priceless memories) that was set to be auctioned off. Julie contacted us, and we were able to use donations from the <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/girl2girl.php">Girl to Girl</a> fund to rescue everything they had just two weeks before auction! We were able to make Christmas morning very special for these two families as we even got to surprise them with checks and special presents. Julie’s reaction will fill your heart with joy.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you all for the amazing Christmas blessings!...Thank you for the amazing way you minister to our hearts and the hearts of our daughters, for the way you show Jesus’ love in practical ways…[you have] changed our lives... I still haven’t found the right words to express the love and gratitude we are feeling. For some people this check would be a nice bonus. For us, it was a</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>game changer</strong>.”</span></i></h3>
</blockquote>
Give a gift that could change things tremendously for a family in need this Christmas. On #GivingTuesday this <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2009456685"><span class="aQJ">December 1</span></span>, we want to raise $10,000 and get 50 new Girl to Girl (G2G) members who will partner with us in ministry and help us reach more families with Jesus’ love.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer 2015 was a weird one for me. It was filled with lessons and growth which led to very frustrating freedom. Sounds like an oxymoron, right? Well, let me explain - for the first time in my life, I actually enjoyed being in my own skin this past summer and it was awesome! I've had had a long, long journey (which I am still on) in learning to love how I was fashioned and formed by God. I have had to learn to accept that I have a naturally bigger framework and curves in what I think are peculiar places. One of my biggest insecurities comes from having grown so quickly when I was a child. When I was born, doctors told my parents I would be in the 90th percentile of height, weight, and growth for kids my age. The result of growing too fast for my skin? Stretch marks - and I have always <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hated</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them! I never wore anything that would show my skin, including shirts with sleeves higher than your typical t-shirt sleeve length because of my marks. But it was hard to be a part of our campaign be around our newest books <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><i>It’s Great to Be A Girl</i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/new-stuff/products/raising-body-confident-daughters"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising Body Confident Daughters</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” without hearing The Spirit speaking to my heart about my body insecurities. The Lord worked on my heart and eyes and helped me to start seeing what He saw in me, and helped </span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">me become comfortable with all the things that make me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including my stretch marks.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With my new found comfortableness in ‘this is me, my body, and I love it’ and my always increasing confidence thanks to working out (oh yeah, endorphins!), I was ready to venture into new fashion territory… (read as "things that showed off just a little bit of skin"). Only I couldn’t in good conscience. Freedom immediately followed by frustration! </span></span></span></span>

<iframe class="giphy-embed" src="//giphy.com/embed/93rI3szziYMYo" width="248" height="248" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand I knew God was healing my view of myself. He was giving me confidence. So why couldn’t I wear what I wanted to wear? If I’m proud of my body now and thankful for what He’s done in it and with it, what’s the big deal with wearing certain things?’ Can you relate? Frustrating freedom is what I felt and to be honest, The Spirit and I battled with this for a few weeks as both my flesh and my spirit were in it to win it. Have you ever been here? What would you do? What have you done?
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the Lord made it very simple. Not easy but simple. I have an immediate authority over me in the form of my job and bosses. How could I wear something that I get on stage and encourage girls every single night <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to wear. God told me this: I can’t rebel against the authority that He’s placed over my life without rebelling against Him. It just doesn’t work that way. We can’t pick and choose the ways in which we </span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obey God. Either we obey fully or we don’t at all.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if I didn’t work for Secret Keeper Girl? What if the school doesn’t have a dress code? What if friends and family around you are shouting ‘there is freedom in Christ!’? Well, yeah there most definitely is. But God took things a bit further for me and I remembered a concept that Secret Keeper Girl co-creator Dannah Gresh discussed in our </span><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mother/Daughter ‘Moonwalking’ Date</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. [BTW: Moms, truth is truth and applicable for us no matter what our age or situation. I don’t even have kids, yet God is always teaching me something from the resources we make available for you and your daughters. I hope </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are taking advantage.] The moonwalking date was not a contest to see who could do the best <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/michael-jackson-moonwalk-Dk1eDBR6mhakE">Michael Jackson impersonation</a> (which would be awesome) </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>but rather about ‘glory'. <strong>Who or what am I glorifying when I wear or <i>don’t</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> wear certain things?</strong> This was a hard question to swallow and it was kind of tricky for my mind to wrap itself around because I just wanted to celebrate and bask in my confidence and how great I was feeling as I took care of the body GOD had blessed me with! </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like something a good Christian girl would think and want to do, right? </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh my friends, so many of us get tripped up in this! Being good for goodness sake or so others will think you are a good Christian means nothing to the Lord. Being good, yeah it looks great on the outside - we say the right things, wear the right things, go to the right places. But may The Spirit always remind us that God is not interested in goodness. His heart's desire is that we be holy. Holiness, because it is about the heart and a person's motivations, always takes things a bit further. Pursuing His holiness means acting solely in the interest of only one person - Jesus Christ. Period. See, on the surface it sounded like I wanted to give God a shout-out as I chose certain clothes, but beneath, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted to be seen. I wanted to show off </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my</span></i></span><i> </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard work. I wanted to show how much </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had grown. There was a deeper lesson for me to learn and God wanted me not only to understand that lesson but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">live and act differently</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a result.</span> <strong>God does things in and through my body <i>not</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> for me but for Him</strong>. Always! He’s concerned about His glory and His name. And the only way to truly please Him is to get on board with His agenda. It’s not about us. Even down to what we do or even do not wear - it’s never about us. And let me tell you, any frustration that comes along with living with His glory in mind (because it <em>does</em> come!) is <strong>totally</strong> worth the gifts of joy, freedom, and intimacy with Him He gives as blessings for obeying Him. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the next time your daughter wants to wear something or do something, even if the reasoning seems good, ask the Holy Spirit to take your mind and heart deeper into holiness. Ask your daughter if what she is thinking about wearing is going to show off God or herself? We believe that is God’s heart concerning modesty and we desire to follow His line of thinking. Also remember that it’s important to pursue complete holiness in the motivations of our hearts. What are your (or your daughter’s) motivations for <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wearing certain things? Is it so God will be honored or so you’ll be seen as a "good Christian girl (or woman)"? You see, it goes both ways and the issue is always where is your heart because either you’re for God’s glory or against it. It’s plain and simple - not easy, but simple. </span></span>
<h4>Share below - Have you ever been frustrated with being modest? How did you handle it?</h4>

A healed and whole mom is equipped to raise pure girls. Conversely, a mom who is unhealed and unwhole will struggled to mentor her girls. We want you moms to walk in spiritual wellness and healing so you can be a truly amazing mother but also so you can be a phenomenal and whole woman of God! That woman who is brimming with spiritual power and life is the type of woman Jesus died to give you freedom to be!

Let's remind you of the truths we learned <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/featured/questions-you-never-want-your-daughter-to-ask/">last week</a>.
<blockquote>Psalm 25:14 (KJV) reads “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will shew them His covenant.</blockquote>
The secret of the Lord are “the people of God who are friends." The Hebrew language describes these people as a <strong>tight-knit group of intimate friends among whom weaknesses, strengths, successes, and failures are shared. Within this circle sins are confessed an<img class="  wp-image-6213 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/o-2-WOMEN-FRIEND-TALKING-facebook-300x150.jpg" alt="o-2-WOMEN-FRIEND-TALKING-facebook" width="370" height="185" />d forgiven</strong>. It's a place where masks of perfection are removed and there is no fear of telling our stories because everyone is <strong>truly known</strong>. <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">The Secret of The Lord</a> is all about living in intimate and open community with fellow believers as you are honest about your dreams, failures, past sins, and goals. We invite start your journey today! Below you'll find the first 3 steps to take toward your spiritual healing as you enter into the secret of the Lord.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step One: Pray</span>
Ask the Lord to help you identity the person you should ask to join you in the secret of the Lord. Often our minds rush to friends or obvious relationships. While the whole idea behind the secret of the Lord is having a <i>group</i> of people who walk in spiritual intimacy with you, it’s often wise to first connect to someone who can mentor you for a while before you begin to open up to peers. God may have chosen someone for you who is not in your immediate circle of influence or who isn’t an obvious match. It may be someone you never imagined so just sit quietly and ask the Lord to give you some names to consider.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Two: Select</span>
Choose someone you know and see often. We really want you to find at least one ongoing relationship where you can grow in spiritual intimacy. That’s not going to happen if you confess to someone who you don’t see all the time. Sometimes confessing to someone you’ll never see again helps you build confidence but that’s not going to help you enter into the secret of the Lord. If you select someone who doesn’t run in your circle, be ready to reconfigure your life to create frequent contact. Select someone who is an older, wiser advisor who will have some perspective that you don’t yet have. Unless you are confessing to your husband, the person you choose should be a woman.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Three: Renounce</span>
Speak out against your past mistakes and sin in the presence of your friend. Once you’ve figured out who to talk to, ask her to set aside some private time to help you talk through some issues and simply let it spill out. After you have spent some time sharing and hearing her advice, be sure to apply the truth of 2 Corinthians 4:2, which says, “We have to <i>renounce</i> secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyman’s conscience in the sight of God.”

The Greek word for the word <i>renounce</i> is <i>apeipon</i>, which means “to speak out against.” So sit down with your new confidant - your first taste of the secret of the Lord - and speak out! Pray out loud in power and authority. Confless. Claim healing. Renounce!

You can’t even imagine how good it’s gonna feel! Ladies, this is the most painful part of entering into the secret of the Lord, but don’t miss it! Adventure and more importantly freedom awaits! A great aid to going through this journey is to go through it with a friend. We don’t want you to let the fear of going through this alone stop you. So we have a <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">BOGO deal</a>, buy one book for yourself, get one for a friend for FREE!! Grab her by the hand and you take these steps toward spiritual healing and abundant living together, in Jesus’ name!

<p style="text-align: left;">Moms, the heart and desires you have for your children are known. We hear you. We see you. The resources we provide are based off of those prayers you pray during the middle of the night as you think about your babies. During those prayers, does your mind ever travel to a deeply hurtful and dark place; a place where you pray to God your daughter never, ever goes near. Are there secrets in your past? Are there things about your life that you pray your children never ask you about. Guess what? You're not alone. We have those places too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Unless we sense that we belong to each other with masks off, the vibrant church of today will become the powerless church of tomorrow.” Larry Crabb</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did something tug in your heart as you read over the word "masks"? That mask you have on tries to convince you that you look as good and are as happy as everyone else but truthfully, you feel as if you're dying on the inside. You’re feeling so lonely and broken and feel totally unknown and the enemy has caused you to believe these lies. Your mask is an isolating barrier that leads to a lack of spiritual power in your life.</p>
Moms, listen. Spiritual power is directly related to your own spiritual health. A physically sick person has a hard time getting up and helping other people, right? Well, the same is true of spiritually sick or weak person. But as you heal, the better you can lead and teach your own children. Having the Holy Spirit alive and active in your life is imperative as you train your children up in God’s way. He’s vital in transforming you into woman, wife, mother that is after His heart.

John 10:10 says that Jesus came that we may <i>have life and have it to the full</i>. <b>Do you know this abundant life? </b>What’s your spiritual pulse like? Are you living in the great adventure and miracles of God? Or are you closer to living in a spiritual coma? Do you long for something more. . . something deeper?

The psalmist King David wrote a powerful prescription for the masked perfection and powerlessness believers are experiencing today.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 25:14 (KJV) reads “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will shew them His covenant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">In it’s most literal translation, the secret of the Lord would be “the people of God who are friends.” It’s us. It’s you. And the Hebrew language describes these people as a <strong>tight-knit group of intimate friends among whom weaknesses, strengths, successes, and failures are shared. Within this circle sins are confessed and forgiven</strong>. Our masks of perfection are removed and there is no fear of telling our stories. We are truly known. The secret of the Lord is the intimate friendship that exists between believers.</p>
We want you to have the power of the secret of the Lord unleashed in your life. It’s real! It’s life-changing! It’s reviving and it’s the door to spiritual power! We encourage you to start practicing the secret of the Lord intimacy today!! First give that tug you feel in your heart to Jesus, right now. Then ask Him to give you courage to call up your best friend and ask her to join you in reading through <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo"><em>The Secret of The Lord</em></a>! There is a <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/secret-of-the-lord-bogo">BOGO deal</a> happening : buy a book for yourself, get a book for your friend for FREE [coupon code: JULYSECRET]!!!

This is the big one, mom! The conversation everyone wants a book to help with.

Basically all Christian psychologists and family experts out there all agree that the big <strong>sex</strong> talk needs to take place much earlier than we, as parents, are generally comfortable having it. What happens if you wait? Jimmy Hester, founder of True Love Waits and editor of the biblically based Christian Sex Education says that  “By ten or eleven years, many children who have not received adequate instructions about the facts of sexuality become disturbed and worry about what is real. They usually have heard bits and pieces of facts from peers.” [Jimmy Hester, ed Christian Sex Education (Lifeway, Nashville; 1995), 42.] Moms, you’ve got to begin to have the conversation about sexuality when your daughter is between the ages of six and ten. This devo will help you initiate this conversation.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Read John 16: 21. Does having a baby hurt? (Answer: Yes. It’s a lot of work for a body to do.) Does a mother remember the pain? (Answer: No. She forgets it and only remembers the joy. You might explain how this has been lived out in your own life.)</li>
	<li>2. How are you feeling about getting your period in the next few years?  (Answers will vary. Help her focus on the positive gift of her cycle.)</li>
	<li>3. Do you have any more questions about how your body creates life? (This is important whether you have or have not already had the sex talk. It may be the prompt she needs to ask what she’s really thinking. If you have had the talk, it may make her feel comfortable asking questions about it. You want to be the authority on all things related to gender and sex so make sure she knows she can ask anything at any time.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Chocolate Date Location Ideas</b>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Factory
</span>Visit a small chocolate boutique or a large chocolate factory and learn about chocolate. Be sure to enjoy taste-testing. Take a bag home to share with dad.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Fondue at a Restaurant
</span>Restaurants like The Melting Pot have killer fondue. Just make sure to make a reservation as it you can wait for pro-longed periods of time if you do not.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Campfire
</span>If the weather is nice, you could consider lighting up a camp fire and making S’mores for this date. Here’s my tip for the world’s best S’more. Find a clean rock and place it near the heat of the fire. Put your graham cracker and chocolate on the rock so the chocolate warms and softens while you are roasting your marshmallow. Be careful it doesn’t turn to liquid chocolate. Yummmm!

As you're bringing up your tween, you're probably starting to notice something - 'hygiene isn’t easy to talk about or teach biblically, simply because there’s not a lot about practical cleansing in the Bible. (There’s much more on ritual cleansing.) But, one thing stands true: your body is a holy temple for the living God of our the universe. Your daughter needs to know this. Her body is a temple of the living God—His dwelling place. And if God is living in [her] body, then it should be cared for better than the Taj Mahal.' So without further ado, here's devo #4 : a "body boosting" bubble bath!

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>A bubble bath

<i>Subject:</i> Hygiene

<i>Setting Options:</i> a Jacuzzi tub at a hotel, grandmas or your own house

<i>Materials You’ll Need:</i>

• Reservations at a hotel, or resort, or grandmas. You might also just plan to do this at your own home.

•A “body boost” gift bag or basket full of hygiene products such as deodorant, shampoo, a razor, and body wash.

<ol>
	<li>1. Read I Corinthians 3:16,17. What does it call your body? (Answer: A temple.) A temple is a place where God lives, so that means God’s Spirit is living in you. How does that make you feel? (Answers will vary.)</li>
	<li>2. Does God’s Spirit live in everyone? (Answer: No. He lives in those who have asked Christ to be the Lord of their life. If you or your daughter have not made this decision scroll down to find the 'The A, B, C’s of Becoming A Christian'.)</li>
	<li>3. If God is living in us, what does that say about how we should care for our bodies? (Answers will vary: we should clean them, provide nutrition, avoid putting harmful substances in them, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Body Boost Gift Basket
</b>Create a fun basket for your daughter that includes items she’ll use in her bubble bath, but also on a regular basis from this day forward. Be sure to include what she’s ready for, but not things she doesn’t yet need. For example, a nine year old may not need acne medication just yet. Hold off on that and maybe just buy her a simple facial cleanser.

<b>The A, B, C’s of Becoming a Christian</b>

Lots of people say they are Christians, but I am fairly convinced that many of them are not. What a sad thing to think that going to church, being good, or calling yourself a Christian would be your ticket to heaven all the while never having actually chosen to follow Jesus Christ in obedience. Jesus himself said he was the only way to heaven. John 14:6 reads: “Jesus said ..., “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Becoming a Christian is not difficult, but many are confused or distracted by things and actions that do not make them any more a Christian than walking on all fours makes me a dog!

<b>A—Admit you are a sinner.</b> A person must start with the confession that she has sinned. She must be both sorry for her sin and willing to stop. It doesn’t matter if it is fighting with your siblings, cheating on a test or—moms—cheating on your taxes or fighting with your siblings! Sin separates us from God. Because he is so perfect and holy, we cannot be in the presence of uncleansed sin. Romans 3:23 says “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” There’s that word again—glory. We cannot reflect God’s image if there is sin in us. And this verse say’s we’re all guilty.

<b><i>If you know you have sinned, pause to verbally confess your sin to Him right now.</i></b>

<b>B—Believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that his death on the cross was payment for all your sins.</b> You may be familiar with John 3:16. That beloved, worn out but never weary Bible verse reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” What kind of love is that? That God would sacrifice his only son so that we can live with him. He so wants you to be a Christian because he loves you.

<b><i>If you believe Jesus is God’s son, pause to verbally say that to him out loud.</i></b>

<b>C—Confess your faith in Jesus out loud and to others.</b> Romans 10:9,10 says that “if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Salvation requires your mouth! You must tell both God and others that Jesus is the Lord of your life.

<b><i>If you want Jesus to be the Lord of your life, begin by pausing to ask him verbally right now. Then, pick up the phone and tell someone! Goodness, hop onto Facebook and tell me. I’d so love to know that you prayed this prayer and have become my sister in Jesus today. Welcome to the family!</i></b>

Before we get started, let's review really quickly!

<b>- <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf">Date #1</a> : Your daughter’s primary purpose is to glorify God. (I Corinthians 6:20)
</b><b>- Date #2 : Your daughter’s primary practice, then, must be to look like him and we do that best in the context of distinctive maleness or femaleness. (Genesis 1:26,27)
</b><b>- Date #3 - Your daughter’s body, therefore, must be living sacrifices to God. (Romans 12:1,2)</b>

Ultimately, God gets to choose how we live out the practice of glorifying him and being faithful to glorify God in our bodies as girls and women requires sacrifice. This is a truth that you need to infuse this truth in to your daughter at a young age. It is God who gets to decide how we work, live, give, spend, marry, and worship. Not ourselves. Because what your daughter does now will affect her future, teach her now that sacrifice is critical and she’ll live it out as you and I have learned to do.

Everyone’s career requires sacrifice. Perhaps none more than that of a mom! But your girl probably sees that everyday, so let’s get her into the shoes of someone with a different career that would interest her.

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>Career Day

<i>Subject:</i> Your body should be a living sacrifice

<i>Setting Options</i>: The office of someone whose career interests your daughter (A vet’s office, a horse barn, a church children’s department, a fireman’s truck, an athlete’s gym, etc.)

<i>Materials You’ll Need at Your Destination: </i>

•An appointment with a person whose career would be of interest to your daughter
•A notepad with questions written in it (see below)
•<a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It's Great to Be a Girl</em></a> book by Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel.

There are two goals during the challenge. The first, is to introduce your daughter to an exciting career that may interest her in the future. The second (but more important) purpose is to introduce her to the act of sacrificing her body in obedience to God’s calling on her life.

Schedule an appointment for her to interview someone whose career would be of interest to her. After she’s had a nice tour of the work area, helped to sell a car, saddle a horse, or paint a wall—let her sit down to interview the person she’s shadowing. You will have already written these questions into a notebook so she can ask them and take notes.
<ol>
	<li>1. What is your favorite thing about your career?</li>
	<li>2. What is the least favorite thing about your career?</li>
	<li>3. How do you prepare or care for your body for this field of work?</li>
	<li>4. What sacrifices have you needed to make in the past for this career?</li>
	<li>5. What sacrifices do you continue to make for this career?</li>
</ol>
For the best results use <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body">It’s Great To Be A Girl</a>.</i> Do Meditation #8 together.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Discuss the interview focusing on the way the person sacrificed in the past and even now. (Answers will vary, but in my own career/ministry calling sacrifices include deadlines that force me to work on weekends or holidays, getting up as early as 3:00am to catch flights to speak somewhere, and being willing to go away from home for long periods of time to fulfill God’s call. I have to take care of my body by exercising or using a computer strains my neck. I also have to eat right or I don’t have the energy I need to make the sacrifices of getting up early and travelling. Taking care of my body is part of the sacrifice because I don’t like to exercise and control my eating but I know that I must to be healthy.)</li>
	<li>2. Read Romans 12:1,2. What does it mean to be a “living sacrifice?” (Answer: It means to give things up like sleep, free time, or hobbies so you can be disciplined and obedient.)</li>
	<li>3. How can you—as a tween girl—practice being a “living sacrifice” today so that you can be obedient to God in the career he calls you to? (Answers will vary but may include: helping you wash the dishes when you ask me, keeping my room clean so I can find things, finishing my homework before I watch TV, and getting up early enough to take care of my body—brushing my teeth, brushing my hair, taking a bath if I need it— before school.)</li>
	<li>4. MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION: Do you know what my career is? (Answer may be “mom” or  she may answer referring to a career you have outside the home. Either way, take this time to tell her that your career as a wife and mom is the most important thing that you do. That you love it more than any other career you’ve ever had and you’d happily be “wife” and “mom” at the expense of all the other careers in the world. Explain to her sacrifices you have made for this. Infuse her with passion for the greatest career in the world: mom.)</li>

In <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOONwalk.pdf">Devo #1</a>, you learned that the purpose of your body, of your daughter's body is to glorify God.

The next conversation to have with your daughter sits solidly on the truth that her primary purpose is to glorify God. Since that means she must make him known and visible, her primary practice will be to look like Him. Have fun on this 'Girls Night Out'!

<i>Challenge Activity: </i>Girl’s Night Out

<i>Key Verse: </i>Genesis 1:27

<i>Key Thought: </i>God made girls to reflect his image.

<i>Suggested Challenge Setting: </i>A fun place to eat out like a tea house or sports club. Use your daughter’s personality to pick the kind of place where you’ll host your girl’s night out.

<i>Recommendation:</i> Do this with a group of women. Ideally, women and their daughters who are using this book. Since each woman will be different in her expression of femininity, your daughter will be able to avoid getting stuck in stereotypes while still embracing her role as a woman.

<i>Materials You’ll Need at Your Destination</i>:

• Each adult or young adult woman attending should bring a photo (pulled from a magazine or taken by herself) that represents what it means to be a woman and why she loves it. (Ideas: This can be a picture of a tom boy playing softball and the woman who shares it can say that she loves being a woman who gets to play sports. Or it can be a picture of a woman with a baby and the woman who shares it can say she loves that women get to give birth and care for babies. You get the idea. Let it reflect the woman. The photos will be as diverse as your guest list.)

• <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It's Great to Be a Girl</em></a> book by Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel.

Select your destination, and invite your guests. Make sure you tell them to bring a photo that is reflective of their style of womanhood.

Once you are at the restaurant, you have one specific task, and it’s very easy: each woman will share her thoughts on womanhood by presenting the pre-selected photo to your daughter (or to the entire group if you are doing it as a small group). (More ideas: This can be a picture of a little girl playing dress up and the woman who shares it can say that she still loves it when she gets to dress up and express her beauty. Or it can be a picture of a woman working and the woman who shares it can say how she loves that God invites women to work hard.) Each photo can be presented to your daughter after it is explained.

You’ll wrap up this sharing time by presenting your own photo and the conversational teaching in this chapter.

Have your conversation at dinner after the meal is cleaned up or during dessert as a group. If you are using <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><i>It’s Great To Be A Girl</i></a>, do Meditation #2 together or assign it as homework.

If you do not have that book, you can discuss these things.
<ol>
	<li>1. Read Genesis 1:27 and talk about the word God uses to describe maleness and femaleness. (Answer: image or statue.) What does it mean that we are the image or statue of God? (Answer: Because he wants others to see him and so we must look like him in some way.)</li>
	<li>2. List some ways that boys and girls are very different. (Answer: Body parts, physical strength, interests, etc.) Review why God would have us be so very different, but still be capable of using us to look like him? (Answer: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are distinctively different and yet unified in to one. Since man and woman are different, but can become united in marriage we are a picture of God.)</li>
	<li>3. Read Ephesians 5:31,32. Talk about how maleness and femaleness comes together to be one. (Answer: Marriage.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Budget Cruncher: </b><i>A Girl’s Night Out at someone’s home can be a less expensive way to facilitate this conversation and every bit as fun. Each woman can bring one dish to share. You and your daughter should either make your food together before you go or make separate dishes. Let her be a part of the food fun! Here are some themes that could make food prep really fun as well as a few recipes. </i>

<strong>Lemon Moon Cookies</strong>

1 box lemon cake mix

2 cups Cool Whip topping

1 egg, beaten

2 T. lemon juice

Mix all of the above ingredients together. The mixture will be like a sticky pizza dough though not stretchy. Take a teaspoon full of batter and drop it into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Then, put the sugar dipped drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 11 minutes. Let cool before letting them melt in your mouth!

Have you noticed it? One minute she's as happy as a lark, and in a matter of seconds she can become enraged with anger or defeated in tears with no explanation at all. Nothing welcomes a tween to puberty quite like <em>mood swings</em>. Before you get frustrated, remember what it was like, Mom. You were there once too.

Hormones. They can make girls feel as though they are riding an emotional roller coaster through puberty. (Others living with a moody tween might find themselves clinging to the roller coaster for dear life!) Your daughter will either learn to control her emotions and feelings, or she will become controlled by them.

In addition to praying for extra grace and patience with your daughter, here are some tips for communicating with and encouraging your moody girl:

<strong>1. You have a choice</strong>. Remind your daughter God not only equipped her body with hormones, he equipped her spirit with self-control. God-given and more powerful than any hormone, self-control is a choice she must make. (Galatians 5:22-23a) Place the ball in her court and remind her that she can choose to respond to her emotions by exercising God's gift of self-control.

<strong>2. Take a moment.</strong> Encourage her to live by truth - she knows God desires us to be loving, respectful and kind to one another. When the mood swing sweeps her off her feet, have her take a moment before she reacts/responds to the situation that has pushed her button. Maybe it's a few deep breaths and counting to ten, going for walk or run, calmly going to her room to cool off and even have a good cry. Honor her need for space and privacy and encourage her to take it if and when she needs space. Mom, use this time to hit your knees in prayer for your girl. Fight for her and ask God for a special does of wisdom, discernment and patience.

<strong>3. Process and pray. </strong>No one can handle her emotions like God can. Rather than exploding on a parent, sibling or friend, have your daughter express her frustrations to God. Whether she's angry, sad, lonely, frustrated, defeated or just plain grumpy, help her find ways to communicate her emotions to the Lord. Maybe it's journaling, listening to worship music, drawing, or going on a hike and speaking out loud to him. He is big enough - he can handle her moods without taking offense.

<strong>4.</strong> <strong>Right the wrong. </strong>When a mood swing strikes, typically girls respond with hurtful words. Proverbs 12:18 says "The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing." If in her moodiness she has lashed out, show her how to make right the pain she may have caused another; support her as she exercises humility and takes responsibility for her actions.

<strong>5.</strong> <strong>Focus on others</strong>. In the midst of a mood swing, our focus is usually on ourself; how we feel, how we were wronged, how we think things should be… There's no better way to dispel a mood swing than by focusing on someone else. Establish a project she can return to when she's feeling a little hot-headed. Maybe she would enjoy crafting fleece blankets for the local animal shelter, writing notes of encouragement to the community police officers &amp; firemen, baking goodies for the nurses at the hospital or making photo collages for friends. By choosing to focus on others, she takes quick control of her heart, mind and emotions and operates with Jesus' servant heart.

<strong>6.</strong> <strong>You need to respect her.</strong> Yes, mom. Respect her. She doesn't understand her mood swings any more than you do at the moment. If you desire your tween to act respectfully toward you, you need to extend the same respect to her. Don't fly off the handle or resort to yelling (or participating in the tantrum with her). Your girl's body is changing and her brain is undergoing serious re-wiring; either of which can make her extremely volatile at times. By no means should you tolerate her tantrum; give her time to pull herself together before you discuss the situation. Ask if she wants you to stay or be alone while she calms down. When she's ready to talk, listen - listen deeply to what she has to say. Even if you disagree with her position, beliefs or current struggle, seek to find a happy middle. Acknowledge your girl's perspective. Hug her - hold her if she'll let you - and express to her how much she is loved. Pray with her about the situation that has upset her and ask that God teach her how to exercise self-control. Let her know that you've been in her shoes before. Remember what it was like for you… draw that grace from your toes if you need to!

Parenting through the tween years can make you feel like you're the one swinging off your rocker! Avoid the temptation to steer clear of your moody tween. This is when she needs your love, affirmation and acceptance the most.

Most little girls become interested in makeup after witnessing her mother put it on many times. It’s normal for girls to want to be and look like their mommies. If you’ve ever wondered why your daughter wants to help you as you clean the house, cook, or fold laundry - here’s your answer: she wants to emulate you! She looks up to you and admires you. She wants to be like you.

Usually her desire to wear makeup is no different. But as your daughter gets older, her reasons for wanting to dabble in makeup will probably expand as she encounters other girls her age. Unfortunately, there is no ‘correct’ age at which your daughter should start wearing makeup. For instance, Dannah began wearing light foundation in seventh grade but I (Charmaine) didn’t start wearing makeup until I was in college. Every girl and every face is different.

We think that instead of asking ‘when can I start wearing makeup?’ the question should be ‘what is your motivation’ for wearing makeup? In <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens/products/its-great-to-be-a-girl-a-guide-to-your-changing-body"><em>It’s Great To Be A Girl</em></a>, authors Dannah Gresh and Suzy Weibel outline three reasons why your daughter may want to wear makeup and what they think of them. We encourage you to go over this part with your daughters.

<strong>Wearing Makeup to Cover-up
</strong> “Lots of people wear makeup to cover up scars, acne, or birthmarks.” This is the whole reason why concealer or coverup exists, but its important to not overuse those products. If you do, not only can this have you looking like a clown, it could also clog your pores which could lead to more zits. Dannah and Suzy remind us that “the Bible says everything should be done in moderation and that can certainly apply to makeup!”

<strong>Wearing Makeup for Beauty
</strong> ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’ We’ve all heard that famous saying and we think it definitely applies here. “Everyone has her own definition of what is pleasing to look at. There is no true false standard when it comes to beauty. So does makeup make a girl look more beautiful? That would depend on those who are looking at the girl.” Besides, most people tend to think that too much makeup takes away from a person’s natural beauty.

<strong>Wearing Makeup to Look Older
</strong> A lot of times, girls start wearing makeup at young ages because they want to look more mature. You know what, that’s kind of just like telling a lie, right? We think so because “lies are anything we say or fail to say - anything we do or fail to do - that causes others to have an impression that is not true.” When you wear makeup to make yourself look like something that you’re not, you’re lying. Girls, we encourage you to enjoy being you, looking like you, and being young. It’s a beautiful and fun time of life!

Mom, when you see that your daughter’s motivation to wear makeup is pure, not for beauty or not to look older, take notice. When you see that your girl understands that her inner beauty is more important than her outer beauty so she isn't afraid to leave the house with an uncovered blemish, she just might be ready for you to take her to the nearest Sephora or Ulta for some fun! But ultimately, the answer of when should my daughter start wearing makeup is answered by “when Mom and Dad say it’s okay” - plain and simple.

<em>Mother/Daughter Challenge: spend more time beautifying your soul than you do beautifying your face. Example - if you spend 5 minutes in the mirror getting ready (with or without makeup), spend at least 6 minutes with Jesus that day. Simple as that! Try it for a week and notice where the greatest change takes place - your face or your heart. </em>

Looks are exorbitantly important in our world today. Our society is obsessed! Too often, it’s not the soul, heart, or character of a person that determines who or what they are. “Everything is about how [people] look and who is beautiful,” which is ironic because most of the beauty we see on television, billboards and in movies has been vastly altered through the power of makeup and magic of Photoshop. It’s fake. Unattainable. Yet it often tempts a lot of us to be unhappy with our natural and God-given beauty. Why is that?

In Dannah Gresh’s latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Body-Confident-Daughters-Conversations-Tween/dp/0736960058"><i>Raising Body-Confident Daughters</i></a>, she explains that “body consciousness is the state of being constantly aware of the body - either others or your own, but mostly your own.” A simple look at your daughter’s actions and priorities can tell you if she is currently body conscious or at risk of becoming so.

Does she have an obsession with clothing and make-up?
Is she constantly noticing the appearance of others or herself?
Does she seem to have body shame?
Does she sexualize herself or others?
Can she walk past a mirror without checking herself out?

If you daughter suffers from body-consciousness, she will most likely fall prey to being unsatisfied with how her Creator made her and try to achieve beauty in unrealistic and sometimes dangerous ways. If your daughter is body-conscious, she has a greater chance of having low self esteem, depression, and making an early sexual debut. Body-<b>confidence</b> is what we want to help your daughter (and you) achieve!

“Body-confidence is the state of knowing your body’s purpose and being able to depend on it to do what God designed it to do without making too much or too little of it.” On a pendulum, it is located somewhere in the middle of caring enough but not too much. How can this delicate balance be achieved? This may surprise you, but teaching your daughter to confidently care about her body in a godly way doesn’t even start with a focus on her body! It starts with an  “[emphasis on] the care of her spirit and [teaching] her to press in to godliness.” The road to body confidence starts with being more concerned with the spirit than the body.

The body is good. Beautiful. Each one is unique and was skillfully created to display the glory of God! But unless the spirit is surrendered to the control of the Holy Spirit, the body will not accomplish its glorious purpose. God, as your daughter’s Master Designer, is the best voice she can listen to on how to care about her body and appearance in a balanced and honorable way.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Job Qualifications</span></strong>
SKG interns are an important part of our team, therefore they need to have the ability to work and communicate well with other people.

Body image is something nearly every woman on the face of God's beautiful earth has struggled with at one time or another. Can't you relate, Mom?

When I take an honest look and give myself an honest listen, I am confronted with my own ability to harm my daughters. They are listening to you and I.

Our daughters listen when we look in the mirror and complain about our hair and wrinkles. They listen when we say we are fat and ugly. They hear us put ourselves down. They hear us compare our bodies and wardrobes to that of <em>Brittany's</em> mom.

Studies have been done to confirm that what a mom says about her own body becomes a consuming thought in her daughter's mind about <em>her own</em> body. The result? One magazine reported that 30% of ten-year-olds are worried about their body image.

Before you can talk to your daughter about having a healthy body image, you must have one! As women we have been made in the image of God. Perfectly Crafted. Wonderfully Made. Dearly Loved.  Mom, we have to be her role model. We must believe what God says about our beauty - we must speak about our own beauty in a positive light  because our girls are listening!

Once you are living in the freedom of God's beautiful creation (your body!) you are equipped to talk with your daughter about having a healthy body image. Dive in to scripture together: 1 Samuel 16:7, Psalm 139, Proverbs 31:30, Ephesians 2:10, 1 Peter 3:3-4. These verses share God's truth about image and appearance. Challenge each other to memorize these powerful Bible verses!

Let me remind you once more - you are her role model! She is watching what you eat, your exercise regimen, skin care routine and demeanor during "that time of the month." Self esteem rises and body image issues decrease as a result of feeling confident and comfortable with one's body. Living a healthy, active lifestyle can aid in this!

You can even create a series of "dates" to help reinforce the truth about body image. My girls and I wake up to green tea and kickboxing with Jillian Michaels! Start <a href="http://motherdaughterfitness.com/faq-exercise-program-to-help-child-lose-weight-and-build-self-esteem/">exercising</a> together, make healthy <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/creamsicle_breakfast_smoothie.html">smoothies</a>, calculate your <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/">BMI</a> and challenge one another to positive exercise and diet changes, have a <a href="http://www.tommynelson.com/2013/05/celebrate-motherhood-with-a-motherdaughter-spa-date/">spa day</a> where you teach her how to properly care for her hair, nails and skin.

Continue to verbally affirm her natural beauty. She's listening, remember? And, if you're anything like me, you could use the affirmation once in a while too.'

I can still see her perched on the shag carpet stairwell to our basement as she watched over giggling girls. Never can I remember falling asleep without my mother's watchful presence perched right where she belonged. Of course, I never knew she was supervising. I just thought she was having fun with us. She giggled more than any of the rest of us.

In recent years, slumber parties have come under the scrutiny of discerning moms. And for good reason: many times these parties are <em>not</em> well supervised, leaving the girls vulnerable to unfiltered Internet access and Netflix selections that you hope your daughter will never watch! (I write about this in more detail in my book <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/parents/products/six-ways-to-keep-the-little-in-your-girl">Six Ways to Keep the Little in Your Girl</a></i>.)

&nbsp;

Christian bloggers Tim Challies and Faith Tibbets McDonald saw first-hand the increasingly controversial nature of sleepovers in their summer blogs, <a href="http://www.challies.com/articles/6-reflections-on-sleepovers">6 Reflections on Sleepovers</a> and <a href="http://www.todayschristianwoman.com/articles/2000/july/losingsleepoversleepovers.html">Losing Sleep Over Sleepovers</a>?.  Both asked the same question, and both received a tremendous conglomeration of responses.  Should I allow my tweenager to sleep over?  Is it safe?  Frankly, it seemed that some had responses that were rather black and white. I'm not sure that's fair. Our communities are different. Our own personal stamina as moms is different. And, most importantly, our children are different. (Keeping my very verbal and extroverted Lexi Gresh from sleepovers when she was ten would have been like asking her not to breath!) I think there is more than one answer to the sleepover question!

&nbsp;

There are three reasonable responses.

1.) One is to have a “no sleepover” policy. I’ve had friends adopt this, and their daughters survive quite well despite what everyone around them says. My dear friend Kim adopted this for her girls, much to Lexi's lament since she adored her daughter. One reason for the decision was her daughters' commitment to ballet. The rigorous schedule of their lives didn't permit for sleepover hangovers the next day! It was the right decision for her and her daughters.

2.) The second is to let your daughter go to sleepovers only at homes where you know the family well and have confidence that what the girls will be doing is safe and morally appropriate. This policy is something I suggest you ease into when your daughter is 10, 11, or 12. Bob and I adopted this one and felt comfortable with our choice. Our daughters were always and only allowed to stay where we felt they were safe and the parents shared our moral values. It was never uncomfortable for me to tell the moms that I had to approve any movies that were shown. (And, I always made it clear that I'd pick my daughter up if everyone else was allowed to see a movie that she was not. Guess what? I did that once! Lexi lives to tell about it.)

3.) But I think the best option is to be the host home. (Like my mom! Frankly, I don't recall sleeping over at other houses at all. Maybe one. And then, I always wished I was at home.)

<i>“For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so he can do the good things he planned for us long ago.” (Ephesians 2:10)</i>

When my Lexi was nine, she went on her first missions trip to Zambia. God opened her eyes there to real need. Not, "But mom I need it" when she was hungry for a candy bar at the grocery store, but "Oh, mom! They don't have any food" in an orphanage where babies were crying from hunger.

When she returned, she recruited an entire neighborhood full of girls and started a fund raising project. She and her friends would sew bananas for dogs and sell them at the local craft festival. My office was home to a gaggle of girls for weeks who left sewing threads and fabric scraps that surely must be embedded in the carpet to this day. They raised hundreds of dollars and sent the money to Africa to help.

My baby did something "good."

Robert Coles, a pioneer in the field of moral intelligence, brings clarity to the definitions of <i>goodness</i> and <i>badness</i> when he writes:
<p style="text-align: center;">  <i>“good…[children]…have learned to take seriously the very notion, the desireability of goodness—living up to the Golden rule.”<a title="" href="#_edn1"><b>[i]</b></a> Whereas bad [children] display a “heightened destructive self-absorption, in all its melancholy stages.” In essence, we go bad when “we lose sight of our obligation to others.”<a title="" href="#_edn2"><b>[ii]</b></a></i></p>
Goodness is the quality that makes us put others ahead of ourselves. It’s the moral compass that keeps the world safe, happy, and working. It’s the drive that makes us want to function in families rather than isolation. It’s the internal road sign that takes us away from our own desires and toward the destiny of meeting the needs of others. Without it, we are “bad.” That’s probably why all of us–male and female—are called to goodness.
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">God <i>is</i> good.</b></p>
The ultimate reason we must raise our children to be good is that it reflects the character of God. God’s goodness is a bedrock truth of Scripture and an inseparable part of his character. If we are to be a picture of Him, we must possess goodness. He is good not only in a general sense, but he is good TO us and FOR us. This element of his character expresses his selflessness and desire to exist on behalf of others. When people are good they act TOWARD and FOR others, as opposed to losing sight of others as their own needs and desires consume them.

Of course, our children embrace being "good", if they see it in us. I'm constantly having to beat my to-do list in to submission so that I can have the flexibility to meet the needs of others. It's not easy in our culture to have space in our lives to care for each other, but we must.

Let's pray today that God would grow goodness in our children. And let us be willing to be an example of it!

<b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Ephesians 2:10:</b>

<em>Lord, you created my children. It is not difficult for me to see that (insert their names) are masterpieces crafted by you. Would you please help them to see it and understand it and know that the purpose of their greatness is to be good. Before they were created, you planned good things for them to do. Help me to guide them to those opportunities. Teach them to be outside of their own needs and get into the needs of others. Let it begin with my example. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“She is clothed with strength and dignity and laughs without fear of the future.” (Proverbs 31:25)</i></p>
Today I am putting one of my children on an airplane and I won't see her for six months. (Gulp.) Autumn is headed to Taiwan for a discipleship training and missions program, and my mother's heart goes with her but my eyes and my mind and my hands are staying behind. And I feel rather helpless.

It is not the first time I have released one into the world. The first time was when Robby went to kindergarten. (I cried then, too.)

I'm fairly convinced that there is an invisible maternal doppler radar system on the top of a mother's head. The detection wand circles our heads with a certainty that each child is where he or she should be according to the schedule we've reviewed over and over again...until the doppler system has nothing to go on and cannot find said children. Then, the detection circle beeps hazardously warning our spirit that no report on that child's EXACT whereabouts can be provided. I don't know about you, but it is then that I feel helpless. (Read: out of control.)

And, frankly, fellow mother...sometimes I act like it. My responses are not full of God's strength. (If they were, I would not have stress attacks, dump all my fears via texts on my husband, and be verbally severe in my conversation with Autumn as we go over her packing list.) Hmmmm...I've got so much growing up to do!

I started this devotion with the intention to help you pray over your child's future. (And we will.) With Autumn departing, my heart is focused like a laser beam on how these next six months will shape her future—much like yours might be as you send one off to kindergarten, get another started in the AWANA program, or decide whether to put one on the traveling soccer team. Each decision we make for our children now, hints at what they will become and gives us pause to pray.

We must be mothers who pray about our children's future. But in my spirit I'm being led to caution you that it is <em>our attitude about their future, not just their future</em> that God wants us to pray over today.

Our children are going to grow up. Step by step. Day by day. Year by year. With each passing phase, they will be less and less traceable as they march into the future. (I know that there are days where a bubble bath is much in order because they are far TOO traceable...as in always under your feet...but with the beginning of the school year we can ponder those releasings, too.) And we are called to a certain response in the letting go... Proverbs 31:25.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proverbs-31-25.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4899 aligncenter" alt="Proverbs 31-25" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proverbs-31-25-300x251.png" width="300" height="251" /></a>

&nbsp;

Laughing.

There should be more of it in my house at these crucial "letting go" times. If I'm truly clothed in his strength and dignity, stress will not spit out of my mouth nearly as quickly as laughter will roll out of it. When I walk my children to the bus in the morning...time to laugh and play not just rush. When I drive them home from piano...time to giggle about the songs their learning not just establish their practice schedule. When I send them off to high school...time to laugh about new friends not just warn them about bad ones. When I drive Autumn to the airport at 5:30 am this morning, time to laugh about the future...not just stress over it by running through instructions for getting through Chicago O'Hare ONE MORE TIME!

How about you, mom? Does the amount of laughter over life changes, schedules, decisions, and the letting go reflect that your heart is fueled by God's strength and you are clothed in dignity? Let's laugh at the future a little today, shall we?

After all, when we're in over our head it is still under his feet!
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Proverbs 31:25:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lord, I want to confess to you that I am often reactive and express more stress than strength. If I truly believe that you are in control of my children's future, my life will display that I'm clothed in your strength and dignity. I give the future of (insert names of your children) to you. I ask you to help me put on the garment of your strength and the beauty of dignity. Fill my home with laughter, not just when times are easy but when I'm considering the future and can become prone to worry. Help me to remember that anything over my head is still under your feet. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.</em></p>

<i>“Then God said, “let us make man in our image, in our likeness…So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26,27)</i>

The other day I was playing with my Facebook account and was shocked to discover fifty-six gender options. They include “transgender,” (for those who feel their gender is different than their sex organs would suggest) “gender fluid,” (in case you like to go both ways) “male to female/mtf” (meaning a sex change is in the making), and you can add a suggestion if you can’t find one of the fifty-six that fit your preference. Please don’t write to Facebook and complain. My point is not for us to boycott anyone, but to raise an awareness in you that your child is growing up in a world that does not embrace the roles of male and female. And there will be a lot of pressure for him or her to embrace tolerance for all gender preferences. Unless, of course, your preference is to stick with God created: male and female. This must be bathed in prayer, mom.

Take another look at Genesis  1:26,27 again.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“Then God said, “let us make man in our image, in our likeness…So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” </i></p>

There are so many God-like qualities that humanity possesses. Why doesn’t God mention the traits of being intelligent or worshipful or creative when he says we were created in his image? Why doesn’t he commend our language proficiency or our ability to compose sonnets? Apparently these are not the things that make us most like a representation of God. It is our maleness and our femaleness that makes us like  Him. This places authentic humanity and sexuality in the context of male and female distinctiveness. Our ability to look like him mandates that we embrace those differences, not erase them.

The book of Romans teaches us much concerning this issue. Disregarding God's definitions for manhood and womanhood is a rebellious refusal to glorify him and an attempt to hide who he is and <i>whose</i> we are.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/“Disregarding-Gods-definitions-for.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4897 aligncenter" alt="“Disregarding God's definitions for" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/“Disregarding-Gods-definitions-for-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/genitalia-are-not-destiny-but-are-they-design">Pastor John Piper puts it this way</a>:
<blockquote><i>God’s divine nature is revealed in the physical, material universe. So much so that verse 20 says, “So they are without excuse” when they “exchange the glory of God for the glory of the creature” (verse 23), or when they “exchange the truth about God for a lie and worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator.” (verse 25).</i>

<i>Paul is saying that the material, physical universe reveals God’s true nature, and his design for humans to worship him.</i>

<i>Then Paul draws the parallel with human sexuality. Just as physical nature reveals the truth about God, so physical nature reveals truth about sexual identity. <em>Whom</em> we should worship is not left to our preferences, and <em>who we are</em> sexually is not left to our preferences. Both are dictated by God’s revelation in nature.</i>

<i>The parallel Paul is making is this: On the one hand, cosmology is designed by God to reveal truth about <em>God’s</em> identity (as powerful and divine); on the other hand, biology (anatomy) is designed by God to reveal truth about <em>our </em>identity (as male and female). This truth is so plain, Paul says, that we are “without excuse” if we don’t see it and agree with it.<a title="" href="#_edn1"><b>
</b></a></i></blockquote>
In Romans, the apostle Paul also begs for us to lay down our own plans for our bodies, and to make them daily, living, breathing sacrifices to our purpose of glorifying God. This includes how we work, live, give, spend and even who we have sex with no matter what gender “preference” might be tempting to us. Those verses read:
<blockquote><i>“I appeal to you therefore...by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12: 1,2)</i></blockquote>
Why did God make you a woman?

Because you were created to contribute to humanity’s purpose of glorifying and enjoying God, and God chose for you to do that as a woman. You illuminate who God is when you embrace the role of womanhood because it is in male and female distinctions that we are the image of God. There will be times when this is a sacrifice for you. And there will be times when it will be a sacrifice for your daughter, as well.

Will you give of yourself (as Christ did), renew your mind, and become a discerning woman of God so that your body may be a beautiful living sacrifice? Will you teach your children to do the same in this challenging world?

<p align="center"><em>By Dannah Gresh, Creator Secret Keeper Girl</em></p>
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Read: Isaiah 54:9-17</b></p>
<p align="center"><b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"></b><i>“All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.” Isaiah 54:13</i></p>
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">As I read Isaiah 54:9-17 today, the rain was pelting so hard against my window and the thunder clapping so loudly that I don’t have to imagine what worry Noah felt when the doors to the ark closed with a thud and a mere man heard wet and wild fury on the other side! It sounds like that in State College, Pennsylvania today. And I’m worried. I worry for my menagerie of barn animals. Is the barn flooding? Is sweet Kanga, our mini fainting goat who is struggling with a bout of lameness, able to make her way to shelter? Will one of my horses slip in the mud?</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">How storms—especially the emotional and spiritual ones—test our faith and rattle our foundation. Doesn’t matter how big (a child starting the school year with a frightening health diagnosis) or how small (a child having trouble making friends at the beginning of the school year), as moms we can be consumed by the storm at the expense of the peace God means for us to know. Each of my three children is facing mini-storms right now, and I’m worried. One is facing overload and stress like never before. Another is having a hard time finding a solid friend to share life with. And then there’s the one struggling with a life change. I just don’t like storms when they impact my children.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">It is such a storm we find in Isaiah 54.</span>

But look at the promises in the midst of it!

Mom, though the mountains shake and the hills be moved, “you will not be shaken,” Mom. “No weapon formed against you will prosper.”

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NO-WEAPON.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4894 aligncenter" alt="NO WEAPON" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NO-WEAPON-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Do you need that today? I sure do.

Nestled in the midst of all these promises for us, is one for our children: “great will be their peace.” I want this for my precious Rob (and his new fiance Aleigha), Lexi, and Autumn. Oh, how I want it! Do you want it for your children? So let’s figure out <i>how</i> it comes to them so we can be sure we cooperate in God's plan to bring it to them. Peace comes with a caveat. The whole verse reads, “Your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.”

A teacher cannot teach a student unless he or she places themselves in the presence of the teacher. Your child cannot be taught by the Lord unless he or she is still and sits under the instruction of the Holy Spirit. If we want our children to have peace in the midst of their storms, it will be found in the sitting.

And that comes for you and I, too. Let us not forget, we are Someone’s child. We are His child. He wants your peace to be great no matter what storm is around you. And that peace does not come from cleaning your house, crossing off your to-do list, managing your children’s schedules, or making <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/dannahgresh/meal-time/">Pinterest</a> worthy meals. (I don’t know about you but my Pinterest recipes never look like the picture, anyway!) The peace you are looking for doesn’t come from the doing. It comes from the sitting.

Sit at His feet if you are in need of peace. As His Spirit instructs your heart, it will be overwhelmed with peace. Mine was today.

And our children cannot learn this if we do not model it, my friend!
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Prayer For Our Children Based On Isaiah 54: 9-17</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lord, there are storms in our lives right now. They include (list them one by one). I feel the shaking of the mountains and the moving of the hills and I need to cling to your promise that neither I nor my children will be shaken. Help me to sit at your feet to be instructed no matter what my house looks like, no matter how big my to-do list may be, and no matter what the needs of my children are. I believe that if I put you first, you will teach me and that will bring peace.

Well, one thing is for sure our days and lives are CRAZY when we're on tour. Here's a taste of what it looks like behind the scenes including a look at the world's largest hamburger (a necessary tour survival tool at midnight) and the staggering gas bill that brings us to you each season.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Backstage.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4759 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Backstage-200x300.jpg" alt="Backstage" width="200" height="300" /></a>

<strong>FACT #1: Our brain is called MasterTour.</strong> Coordinating up to 50 tour stops in three months with a tour team of up to 12 and an off-road management team of only 4 takes a brain. And we have one. It's called MasterTour. Each team member has this app on our smart phone it tells us everything from when we get to sleep to what city we will be in tomorrow to who we will meet when we get there. Here's what our map looks like at the beginning of a season.

PIC
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Our tour map for Fall 2015<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FACT #2: Our bed is a bus.</strong> God blessed us last year with the ability to upgrade from van transportation/hotels to a tour bus that we sleep on while we drive. (Well only one of us drives and he doesn't sleep.) Shout out to NewSong who previously owned the bus and used it for WinterJam, the world's largest concert tour! We wake up each morning to the same view: the back side of a church parking lot (and maybe a team member like Haley having her morning beverage whilst sitting on the front dash. The glasses are mandatory since we don't get the chance to wash up before we're in the church. We don't want to scare anyone now, do we?)</p>
<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4771 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="photo" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year we travelled 37,223 miles in our tour bus and used $38,459 worth of gas. (That's a lot of gas!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #3: We blow up a lot of balloons each morning.</strong> Each event requires stage set up that takes us about 3 hours. No one gets the morning off. We all help set up lighting, sound equipment, staging pipe and drape, the resource table signs and banners, books, and lots and lots of balloons. The balloon sculptures for the stage take about an hour and require several volunteers from our host church (whom we love so much) managed by one team member such as Lexi who handles our 7' crazy hair column topper with expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4762 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balloons-300x252.png" alt="Balloons" width="300" height="252" /></a> <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4765 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n-225x300.jpg" alt="155494_10151958993677476_1161446385_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Last year we spent about 80 hours blowing up 17,760 balloons.</em></p>
<strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #5: We manage a lot of clothes and props backstage.</strong> From the world's largest chicken egg to a complete set of authentic vintage clothing from four different decades, our stage team manages all of its own props. We put them out in the morning and do a careful accounting of each item at the end of each night. Heather (vintage clothing coordinator) and Jordan ("It's Sew Crazy" tween fashion show designer) are seen below organizing one of our wardrobes last season.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4766 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n-300x225.jpg" alt="312397_10151592707937476_589300131_n" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<em>The Crazy Hair Tour uses 111 props each night including the world's largest sling shot! </em>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #6: Every day we do a sound check.</strong> The last thing we do before daily team devos and lunch is our sound check. We're usually excited by this point because it means we're almost to the part of the day that we get "off." From about noon to four we get to hang out in our bus home or get a shower in a local hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4769 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n-225x300.jpg" alt="10174875_10152090375597476_2434753681614482553_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Charmaine...it might look like a sound check, but she's thinking about lunch.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">FACT #7: We eat at midnight.</strong> They say that being on stage for one hour is the equivalent of a 4 hour workout. Since we're on stage for nearly three hours, we are starving by the time the bus is loaded up and our pjs (comprised of sweat pants and sweat shirts) are on. We have been known to eat burgers the size of our heads (Lexi) and pizza no less worth talking about (Suzy) at midnight which is when we roll on out of one city and head to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4768 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Burger-294x300.png" alt="Burger" width="294" height="300" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last year our food budget was $11,799. (We eat less than the bus, that's for sure!)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After our midnight snack, it's off to bed in our trusty tour bus. And on to the next city to do it all over again!</p>

I don't know about everyone else, but I'm poised to contribute to a conversation that says men are good in an effort to dispel the myths perpetuated by lousy commercials that have been the norm for far too long. Move over myths, there's a #HowToDad movement on the prowl complete with advice on how to treat your wife and what to do when your son attempts to scare the tar out of you before your feet hit the ground.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Myths TV Perpetuates</strong></p>
We have a bad boy—as opposed to a good men— mentality in culture. One reason is that the a cultural movement told us they are bad. Michael Gurian, author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Boys-Michael-Gurian/dp/1585425281">The Wonder Of Boys</a></em>, though seeming to embrace the feminist movement as a whole points out a few devastating myths it introduced to convince our boys that they are “bad.” Here are two that resonate with me:
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Myth Number One:</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“that masculinity is responsible for the world’s ills and femininity is the world’s salvation.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Myth Number Two:</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“males destroy, females create; males stand in the way of positive spiritual/social values; males are inherently violent.”</em></p>
Just consider how prevalently these two myths are portrayed in the media. Television alone reinforces them with programs like Modern Family where the guys are sweet, but stupid. (Even the reruns of The Simpsons portray the contrast between bright and beautiful Lisa and stupid and out-of-shape Bart.) Co-ed television commercials often portray the guy as ditzy and the girl as smart. It’s funny. It really is. But how much of it can we expose ourselves to before we believe it? How much can our sons and husbands be exposed to before they plummet into self-fulfilling prophecy mode?

Today’s men as a whole have pretty much rolled over and taken it. But this viral Cheerio ad gives me hope. Hope that boys can be taught to grow up to be good men
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> Goodness vs. Badness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robert Coles, a pioneer in the field of moral intelligence, brings clarity to the definitions of goodness and badness when he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“</em>good…boys…have learned to take seriously the very notion, the desireability of goodness—living up to the Golden rule.” Whereas bad boys display a “heightened destructive self-absorption, in all its melancholy stages.” In essence, we go bad when “we lose sight of our obligation to others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Goodness is the quality that makes us put others ahead of ourselves. (And this quality is so vibrant and visible in the Cheerio's ad.) Goodness is the moral compass that keeps the world safe, happy, and working. It’s the drive that makes us want to function in families—from waking up with scary horse masks up our nostrils to making coffee for each other— rather than isolation. It’s the internal road sign that takes us away from our own desires and toward the destiny of meeting the needs of others. Without it, we are “bad.” That’s probably why all of us–male and female—are called to goodness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with goodness.”
Romans 12:21</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The New Testament Greek word for “goodness”—used here and in other places— appears in three forms, all of which are rooted in the Hebrew word “tob”, which meant “usefulness.” Are we bringing up boys who understand their call of duty to be useful contributors to society? One important component of helping boys understand their duty, is portraying it in the mediums of our culture. That's why I think the Cheerio's ad is an epic victory for those of us who believe that men are good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. Someone go buy some Peanut Butter Cheerios and send a message that we like this message. A lot.</p>

Unlit. Unretouched. Un-size-0! Robyn Lawley is proof that a size 12 is not a plus size. (The modeling industry categorizes anyone over a size 6 as plus.)

While not every teen or tween girl should see these photos, many should. It might make them think differently about their own body.

A picture is worth a thousand words.

Here are some conversation starters if you decide to take time to look at Lawley's <a href="http://www.myfoxchicago.com/story/26102615/australian-model-posts-untouched-bikini-photo">unretouched (and often immodest) photo library</a>.
<blockquote>•This model tried to get smaller, but couldn't. Based on the photos, do you think she needed to be smaller?

•You begin to believe anything you dwell on. Knowing this and seeing the truth in these photos, do you think it's a good idea to feast on fashion magazines?

•If the modeling industry is not representing all sizes, but represent anorexic (eating disorder) sizes what does this say about who they represent? Should we want to look anorexic?

•Since we can't get a true picture of beauty (literally) from the modeling world, where should we look?</blockquote>

<em>We posted it as a question for moms to discuss and it got a little "opinionated." One mom even defended the fact that her daughter just thinks it is fun and punctuated it by posting an adorable photo of her and her girl giving us "duck face!" I, Dannah, asked Secret Keeper Girl lead teacher Charmaine Porter to weigh in. And...here she is with a really silly "duck face"!</em>

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-1-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4735 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/photo-1-3-225x300.jpg" alt="photo 1 (3)" width="225" height="300" /></a>

The photography phenomenon, known as “duck face” seems to have taken the social media world by storm recently. It started on television, in fashion magazines, celebrities picked up the trend. And NOW it’s trickled down to your little girl! Is it OK?

Because of the world we live in, our children tend to associate beauty with what they see on Facebook, Instagram, and on TV and movies. Since celebrities and models do the duck face, the thinking in a tween girl might be like this: "The world has deemed this celebrity/model as beautiful… she is making the duck face… maybe I need to do that to be beautiful as well."

It’s normal and natural that your daughter wants to be and feel beautiful and there’s nothing wrong with that. After all, moms, don’t you want to feel and be beautiful as well? But, as we say on the Secret Keeper Girl tour, Christians are supposed to go a bit beyond what’s normal and right into unique and crazy for Jesus! Let's analyze "duck face" in this light.

1.) <em><strong>Your daughter may have pure and simply silly intentions when she makes "duck face." </strong></em>After seeing a comment posted by a mom and totally agreeing with her, I feel this should where we begin. The main issue with “duck face” is not the act itself but the motivation and heart behind it. So as you communicate and discuss this with your child, if “duck face” is just a fun, silly thing she likes to do, then by all means, LET HER PLAY! And, as one mom suggested, play with her and be a part of those silly photos. She’s a child with a fun personality and that shouldn’t be quenched.

2.) <em><strong>If your daughter's intentions don't seem pure and silly, dig a little deeper in conversation to see what they might be.</strong> </em>Ask her WHY she is posing that way. Why is she contouring her face ? Ask her WHO she saw posing like that if that person is someone she truly desires to model or emulate. Many of the models and celebs who pose like this do have trashy sensual intentions. I'm not the only one who thinks this either: “[Duck face] is meant to be seductive, although why anyone would think ducks are sexy, I don't know.”[1] As an example, here's a carefully cropped photo of one of this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SImodel.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4738" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SImodel-300x195.jpg" alt="SImodel" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
While your daughter may not think sexually about her lips at all, make sure she's not copying sensual behavior and believing it to be "beauty." If this is what's in her head, explain to her the intentions of the models and that copying that kind of behavior is not ok.

3.) <em><strong>Use the conversation as a chance to discuss what God's word says about our beauty.</strong></em> Turn to the Word of God. While we won’t find mention of "duck faces" in the Bible, we do see that even back in Biblical times, people were more concerned with outward than inward beauty. There truly is nothing new under the sun! A great place to start is with this favorite Secret Keeper Girl verse:
<blockquote>"Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or beautiful clothes. You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so precious to God." I Peter 3:3-4 (NLT)</blockquote>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">A good modern day paraphrase might read: "Don't be concerned about outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, beautiful clothes, or carefully posed duck face selfies!" True beauty can’t be captured in a pose or photograph. True beauty and attractiveness is not found in duck lips.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">It comes from the presence of God.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #444444;">There is nothing wrong with wanting to be and feel beautiful; it’s one of the most fun things about being a girl! So let’s model and teach your daughter to make sure that her heart is even more beautiful than how she looks on the outside. Talk. Discuss. Ask questions. Let her speak. And above all else, encourage her to spend more time in the mirror of God’s word discovering how “look” truly beautiful (more like Him) and a little less time practicing silly poses in the mirror trying to mimic the latest trend.</p>

<h3>What does the Secret Keeper Girl Event Look  Like?</h3>
Just push play for a peak at some of last year's fun!

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sOPlBUdrh2g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h3>What is Secret Keeper Girl?</h3>
Secret Keeper Girl is a program that is the brainchild of the dynamic <a href="http://purefreedom.org/meet/dannah/">Dannah Gresh</a>. Gresh is an author and speaker who wants girls to know that they are more than what society tells them they are. Out of this idea came the book “Secret Keeper.” This book teaches girls about the necessity of maintaining their modesty and keeping appropriate relationships with boys until they are married. Secret Keeper Girl offers advice and interaction for moms and tween girls. For example, “<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/petition/">The Modesty Project</a>” is a petition started in 2009 to encourage designers to make more modest clothing for girls. And, we have "date” kits for mothers and daughters to have fun while discussing important topics.
<h3>What is the current Crazy Hair Tour Like?</h3>
If you ever wanted an opportunity to really let your hair down, the <em>Crazy Hair Tour</em> is it.

First, you and your daughter can dress as fashionably silly and fun as you want, as long as it is modest. Then, if you are feeling it, you can pick the craziest hairstyle you can imagine.

Once you arrive at the event, you will be swept up in a storm of excitement. The <em>Crazy Hair Tour</em> is a game show and fashion show rolled into one. You can enjoy competing in the games, learning about current fashion, and see how the Bible stays relevant, even in modern times. The point of the show is to help persuade girls to be “God-crazy” instead of boy-crazy. That way, they will get more direction from the Bible, and take less advice from fashion magazines.
<h3>Who wants to go?</h3>
This event is targeted at Tween girls (ages 8-12) and their moms. It is popular for the girls because the show gets you up on your feet and the fun never stops. Moms like it because it spreads a message they feel is hard to get across, as girls get more and more influence from worldly people and agendas. There are <a href="http://purefreedom.org/tour">many stops on the Crazy Hair Tour</a> this fall, in the following states:
<ul>
	<li>Florida</li>
	<li>Tenneessee</li>
	<li>Mississippi</li>
	<li>Iowa</li>
	<li>South Carolina</li>
	<li>North Carolina</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania</li>
	<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

My heart was just bursting with the good work God had done at our recent FREE outreach event with Brooklyn Tab just a few weeks earlier. So, I got on the stage and told the moms and girls of Tennessee about it. About how my team prayed one-on-one until each and every sexually broken mom or girl had been loved on. How we left behind a partner—Brooklyn Tab— with the strength to continue walking with them, but just a little more fueled and armed to do battle for them. How I'd prayed with the most precious little girl to receive Jesus as her Lord and Savior...and the photographer had caught me kissing her on the head.

We LOVE reducing the risk of early sexual debut and brokenness in high risk pockets of community. It is our greatest honor to encourage girls to write a different legacy than their community expects them to write.

I stood up filled with the passion of having just seen God's Spirit rescuing girls...for the fourth time in Brooklyn. And how we've had to say "no" to requests in Detroit, Philadelphia, and even overseas. I told those moms and girls in Tennessee all the details.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4536 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n-300x200.jpg" alt="1536744_10151922994827476_1956555678_n" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Then they told me something. Those moms and girls of Tennessee told me and my team that they wanted the answer to be "yes" from now on.

How did they tell us?

With dollars. Lots of them. And before we knew it we had funding to do more outreach events. We've already fully funded grant events in the following locations and located event coordinators who are so full of the hope and love of God that they want to pour it out where it's been missing. In the fall we will go to:
<ul>
	<li>Belle Glades, Florida (Ashley Tripp)</li>
	<li>A suburb of Richmond, VA (Truin Huntley - First Things First)</li>
	<li>East Liverpool, OH (Cindy Popejoy)</li>
</ul>
And, while the majority of our funding will stay right here in the United States, we are planning a very important trip for next year to bring sexual wholeness to girls experiencing "survival sex" in Haiti.

Moms and girls at our live events have blessed us so much that we thought we should name this gentle, but strong move of God's Spirit for girls to help girls. So, we have.

Mother/Daughter kitchen dates are some of the best, right Mom?

<strong>Purple Flurp</strong> is featured in one of our <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens">Secret Keeper Girl Fiction Series</a> books, <i><a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/collections/tweens/products/danikas-totally-terrible-toss">Danika’s Totally Terrible Toss</a></i>. Danika takes some of her mom's famous Purple Flurp dessert to school. But, it's not eaten… something goes terribly wrong! (You'll have to read to learn what happened!)

We recently had a mom and daughter write in and ask us if  Purple Flurp is a real recipe. You bet it is!
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Secret Keeper Girl Purple Flurp</b></p>

You’ll need:
<ul>
	<li>1 can of crushed pineapple</li>
	<li>1 can of blueberry pie filling</li>
	<li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
	<li>1 8 oz. tub of Cool Whip</li>
</ul>
Mix the three canned items together and refrigerate them overnight. Add the tub of Cool Whip right before you serve it to all your friends. This Secret Keeper Girl tried it and said, "It's super good!"

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How can I simply make conversation with my daughter? I don’t know what to talk about. </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Sometimes it does seem like girls do speak a different language. Many fathers have been clueless at times too! Have you ever said something to your princess that evokes sudden anger or a waterfall of tears?  You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? What did I say wrong this time?

Even if she tires to shut you out or “doesn’t want to talk to dad about it,” there are tried and true ways to make conversation with your daughter that often opens up the door to her heart.

It’s that inner child thing. Stop and try to remember what it was like to be her age. Consider the things you loved, the things you hated, the things you cared about. It really isn’t probably all that far off.

As men, it really is amazing some of the things we put to memory. You probably know the stats for your favorite sports team. Countless song lyrics. Random facts about technology. Stock numbers… Study your daughter - know her like you know your favorite team; after all she is far more important to you, right?

Think of it this way: <strong><i>you should date your daughter</i></strong>. If you're still stumped, check out <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/8-great-dates-for-dads-and-daughters-understanding-boys"><em>8 Great Dates for Dads and Daughters</em></a> to get started! What questions would you ask on a regular date? Do you know her teacher’s name?  Who in her class has a “boyfriend”? Why she dislikes PE so much?  What’s her favorite song? If you can’t answer all of those questions confidently, you’ve got plenty to talk about! The time that she actually will <i>want</i> to spend talking to you will all-too-quickly come to a close. Don't take that time for granted - start with these:
<ul>
	<li>Who is your best friend? Why? What do you like about him/her?</li>
	<li>What is your biggest goal this year? How can I support you?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite meal?</li>
	<li>What makes you worry?</li>
	<li>If someone gave you $50, how would you spend it?</li>
	<li>What would you like to do when you grow up?</li>
	<li>What is your favorite activity we do together?</li>
	<li>What makes you feel loved?</li>
	<li>What is your dream vacation destination?</li>
	<li>Who do you consider to be your hero and why?</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How Can I Spend Quality Time With My Daughter If I Really Don’t Have That Much Time to Spare? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
The Pew Research Center conducted the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/14/men-women-work-time/1983271/">American Time Use Survey</a> in 2012 and discovered that fathers spend 7 hours with their children per week – much of that time involves technology (meaning you’re parked in front of the tv or computer). Convicting much? We must make time! Simple as that. She needs you! Yes, work and responsibilities are an important and necessary part of life. However, if your daughter feels that work is more important to you than she is, it might be a good time to reevaluate your schedule and priorities. Ask her. I dare you.

Consider when you really do have time to be fully focused on her. Block that time off and plan intentional activities or events and put them on your calendar in advance. It is so easy to become wrapped up in work, busyness and the full-plate that comes with parenthood, that we forget how to slow down, have fun and enjoy life. Put away your laptop, turn off your cell phone, and genuinely be with her. Even if you’re not able to have the quantity of time with your daughter that you’d like, make sure the time you do spend is quality time.

Using the time, energy and resources you do have, rekindle your creativity and get in touch with the child inside you.  Capitalize on her interests. Do what you know <i>she</i> would enjoy. Maybe you should go camping or fishing for a weekend. Have mornings free? Take her out to breakfast once a week before school and work begin. She won’t remember the deadline you had or the make-or-break meeting you were stressing about, but she will remember the intentional times you made her your sole focus and priority. She just needs you. All of you. Your focus, energy and attention. Make the time. When she is 18 and pulling out of your driveway for college you will wish you had more of it.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>How can I build my daughter’s confidence? </i></strong></p>
</blockquote>
While you can and should verbally affirm your daughter on a daily basis, I find that teaching her something seems to boost her confidence level. I believe that the handyman does not always have to be a guy. Spend quality time with her by teaching her: how to fix the toilet when it overflows, car maintenance, setting a mousetrap, finding the water main, repairing the fence, painting the wall – even killing a spider. It can be empowering for her to know that she is strong and capable and that she doesn’t always need a rescuer to do it for her.

Teaching her life skills like budgeting, yard work, and house repairs equip her to be self-sufficient and teach her that she can be independent. Build her up and encourage her as you work on projects together. Let her have a shot at it. We’re already proud of our daughters – but sometimes it’s nice to watch her be proud of herself.'

<em>Hey Secret Keeper Girl Dads!</em>

<em>It's about time we offered some tips to you! We imagine you have just a few questions about your tween daughter, like “Is she really from another planet?” In this blog series, Bob Gresh, author of <a href="http://pure-freedom.myshopify.com/products/8-great-dates-for-dads-and-daughters-understanding-boys">8 Great Dates for Dads and Daughters</a> will answer some of the most frequently asked questions we receive from Dads.</em>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Is it OK to be involved in my daughter's dating life when she's older?</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Ummm… YES. It’s not ok for you <i>not </i>to be involved! I firmly believe in interviewing the gentlemen who have taken interest in my girls. Lord knows I’ve put a few young men through the most intensely awkward interview of their life! It was not at all to demonstrate my power as Dad, but to protect my girls and create a system of accountability and expectation for the boy driving them to the movie theater.

I wouldn’t wait until she’s older… I would get involved in her dating life NOW. When she’s 10 it’s much easier to express your desires for her dating relationships as well as family rules and boundaries than when she’s 16.

At some point, you have to tell your kids point-blank what your standards and expectations are. We adopted the dating protocol of the LaHayes after reading their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Sexually-Pure-Kids-Children/dp/1576733920"><i>Raising Sexually Pure Kids</i></a>. We decided to let our kids go on group dates for special events as soon as they hit high school. That means they could go on a chaperoned formal event, if they wanted, at the age of 14 or 15.

Our teenagers were allowed to go on single dates when they were 16, as long as we were actively involved in the planning and execution of the evening. What do I mean by “actively involved”? Well, Lexi and Autumn always knew that a guy who wanted to take them out has to go through an interview with me. Period. If the boy seemed to have honorable intentions and was someone we felt comfortable with, we most likely allowed them to spend a carefully planned, very public evening together. We were approving everything they did, and they were in close contact with us.

Finally, we discouraged our girls from being in any exclusive relationships until they were out of high school. We really wanted them to enjoy their high school years free from the drama relationships tend to bring, and we didn’t want their heart wounded by excessive relationships.

I can’t overestimate the importance of establishing and communicating your family’s dating standards when your daughter is a tween, even if that seems difficult. I also can’t understate how easy it is. My kids’ hearts were so innocent that it was just comfortable and natural to discuss. My girls still thought boys had cooties! It’s easy to establish your standards if you do so before their hormones kick in and “everyone else” has a boyfriend.

The young men who show an interest in your daughter and desire to spend time alone with her need us to hold them accountable for their actions, words and thought life. There is a huge need for more men – older men, dads, youth pastors – to challenge them to protect our daughters, their sisters in Christ, and do what is necessary to guard their heart as well as their purity.

Dennis Rainey, President and CEO of FamilyLife raised four beautiful daughters and wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interviewing-Your-Daughters-Date-Man-To-Man/dp/1602005257"><i>Interviewing Your Daughter’s Date</i></a><i>.</i> It is a great resource to consider when your daughter begins to date.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How do I talk to my daughter about her period? Should I acknowledge it? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Yes, I said "her period." Breathe, man. It’s not rocket science. Your daughter is growing up way too fast before your very eyes and there isn’t a thing you can do to stop it. If you’re anything like me, this can be very difficult to watch… after all, she is our <i>little </i>girl.

Nearly forty percent of girls starting their period have never heard about it from their parents. It’s not uncommon for girls to approach this phase of puberty and suddenly feel uncomfortable around Dad. She might not want you to hug her or love on her the same way you’ve always done. She may suddenly become embarrassed or stand-offish. Girls are often confused by their body changes and are embarrassed to talk about it… especially with you.

You might think this is “mom’s job.” Well, the truth is, the best way for you to help your daughter transition into womanhood is to get involved. Don’t skip out on this important event in your daughter’s life! Yes, it’s probably going to seem really awkward… you want to show your daughter support; that you’re compassionate and understanding of everything going on in her heart, life and body. When she sees this in you, it’s likely she will become more accepting of the changes and confident as a result.

I know this is a hard one – but you will survive. It’s so worth knowing that your daughter doesn’t feel she has to hide from you or feel embarrassed by you knowing. The more open you can be with your girl; the more honest and transparent you can be – the better off she will be! One of the greatest things you can offer your daughter, especially when she begins her period is your love, approval and acceptance.

Consider celebrating this milestone with an extra-special date night or a meaningful letter or gift. Show her you’re on her team. You.will.be.ok. Remind her that she will always be your little girl and you love her just the same.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>How can I enforce modesty in a way my daughter respects?</i></strong></p>
It’s likely you’ve seen <i>that</i> dad who wore super short shorts out in public to “teach his daughter modesty.” Funny for the rest of us. "Way to go Dad," right? I don’t know about the daughter though. Something was needed to prove his point, but I think intentional public humiliation is not always the best. Point being, encouraging our daughters to be modest can be a great undertaking.

Have you heard this statement? “But DAD… Everyone else is wearing it.” Don’t underestimate your influence when it comes to modesty. Your approval is extremely important to your daughter. Before you resort to the short-shorts method, go shopping with her. I realize this might not be your favorite activity, but the girls seem to respect their fathers more when we are willing to show interest and have an input in the selection process, knowing modest clothing can be very hard to find.

Have her try on the clothes and model for you. Affirm her natural beauty and be cautious in how you address “inappropriate” clothes. Your language and your tone matter to her confidence. Yes, I know you’re in a mall. In a girl’s store. Shopping. Please be patient and tender toward her. Point out the positive, "I really like the color of that shirt - It brings out your eyes. Maybe we can find one in another size."  A little affirmation before your "It's too tight/short/see through..." will help her be more responsive to your opinion.

Along with overseeing your daughter’s closet and shopping trips, it’s important we lead them to the Word to show them God’s perspective on true beauty and modesty as well as the temptations and struggles of men. Without clear standards reinforced by scripture, modesty will become simply rules she resents rather than a lifestyle she embraces.'

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Does my relationship with her mother really affect my daughter? </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
Yes. Yes it does.  John Wooden is quoted for saying, <i>“The greatest thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.”  </i>In loving her mother well, you’re not only teaching her about love, loyalty, compassion, respect, commitment, trust and tenderness, you are demonstrating it before her very eyes.  You can show her by the way you love and honor your wife that she should never settle for less than that. She will learn from <i>you</i> what qualities to look for and expect in a future husband.

I understand that some of you reading this come from broken relationships. Even if your daughter’s mother is now your ex, there is a godly way to honor her, to speak highly of her, and bless her. Your daughter is watching and she is watching more closely than you think.

If you are currently in a toxic or unhealthy relationship, that is not positively changing or if you’re not receiving counsel, you are essentially telling your daughter that this is <em>ok </em>for her future. If one day your daughter came home and told you she was in a similar relationship being treated the way you (or your wife) is, how would you feel? Would your heart break for her? You’re setting the bar. As the leader of your home, you set the tone and the pace for your wife and your children. I encourage you to genuinely and increasingly love her mother. Treat her with respect and a decent amount of PDA! When your little girl grows up it’s likely she will look for a man who treats her much like the way you treated her mom.

Be the dad that comes home and kisses your wife in front of the kids. They may scream or cover their eyes and say, “Ewwwww” but they will <em>know</em> you love her. Don't let that even  be a question in your child's mind! Your daughter will recognize that she wants a husband like you some day.

Strive to love her mother. Love her well. Love her better each day. Your daughter needs to see love demonstrated. Ready, set, go.'

Hopefully, you're daughter was all tucked into bed when the Grammy's started out with grinding Sunday night, but it's likely that some girls her age—perhaps friends at school—were glued to the television. Pre-show media touted the 2014 Grammy Awards as a family affair. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/table-talk-2014-grammy-awards_n_4660600.html">Huffington Post</a> even offered a table talk guide and ideas to help kids "cultivate the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the contribution of recorded music to American culture."

But what the world saw—from grinding to explicit lyrics to darkly themed performances to a "church" service— was not appropriate for young viewers, and you may need help navigating post-show conversations with your kids whether they saw the show or are just hearing about it from friends. And—whether you realize it or not—there really is something worth talking about.

Her name is Natalie Grant.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Natalie-Grant.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4012 aligncenter" alt="Natalie-Grant" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Natalie-Grant-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

&nbsp;

Grammy-nominated, five-time Dove Award winning recording artist Natalie Grant has found herself in a Hurricane. (Appropriate, due to her current chart-topping song.) She's been assaulted by media attention that's fueled with criticism–and a sprinkling of approval— for leaving the Grammy's. (I can only begin to image what it looks like in the eye of her media hurricane because when I posted a news article about her leaving the Grammy's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dannah-Gresh/204435266257157?ref=hl">my Facebook</a> post was viewed by over six million people! And the nearly 5,000 comments were often heated and divisive.)

Natalie has not publicly stated why she and her husband decided to leave, but was careful to tell people of her choice when she tweeted:
<blockquote><em><strong>@NatalieGrant</strong></em>
(1 of 2) We left the Grammy’s early. I’ve many thoughts, most of which are probably better left inside my head. But I’ll say this:

I’ve never been more honored to sing about Jesus and for Jesus. And I’ve never been more sure of the path I’ve chosen.</blockquote>
I think that Natalie has placed into our hands one of the greatest life lessons your daughter will ever get to see and it's worth talking about. Here are a few important points I'd make when talking to my daughters (or sons).

<strong>1.) Sometimes God's Spirit calls Christians to be in places where He is not welcomed.</strong> A lot of the Christians criticizing Natalie have stated that she shouldn't have been at the Grammy's to begin with. (One pastor, confusing me for Natalie, posted this to my Facebook page:
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">So proud of your stand...</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">now promise to never go to this kind of trash again.</h5>
</blockquote>
That thinking wreaks of legalism and a lack of relying on the Holy Spirit. Sometimes God's Spirit calls us to be light in the darkness.

I remember a time when my Lexi was only twelve years old and I dropped her off at pottery class. The basement studio was small and each week had a new art galleria in the lobby. On this particular night the display was purely Satanic and pointedly spiritual. Sensual sculptures of Adam and Eve. Burned out clay skeletons. And at the back of the gallery a large Bible opened to a page in Revelation. Every word had been blacked out except three which went connected made this sentence: "God. Is. Dead." Everything in me wanted to take Lexi and run. (And to give the owner a piece of my mind.) Instead, I prayed. And God seemed to be telling me to let her stay. I spent then next hour prayer walking the block.

Do you know that the displayed opened up a spiritual conversation during class, particularly of the existence of heaven and hell? And my sweet Lexi, arms deep in slippery clay, lovingly testified of her faith to her Agnostic teacher and a teen in the class who said she was an Atheist.

I think Natalie's work is marked with God's spirit. So she and her husband Bernie probably sensed God giving them a green light to go to the Grammy's. And clearly, while they were sitting in the audience they had an on-going conversation with the Holy Spirit who prompted them to leave. What a great example for our children! How I would have loved to have talked about Natalie's decision with my Lexi when she was twelve.

I've said this before, but let me say it again:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT ABOUT RAISING YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SET APART IN THIS CORRUPT CULTURE, YOU WILL BECOME A PARANOID MOTHER WHOSE LEGALISM DOES NOT ALLOW HER CHILDREN TO FACE THE GIANTS GOD MEANS FOR THEM TO FACE!</p>
</blockquote>
Natalie and her husband faced their own Goliath at the Grammy's. And I think they were called to it. It would be great if the Church gave her an "atta girl" rather than added to the criticism. We can't quiet those that say hurtful things, but what we can do as mothers is teach our daughters to follow in Natalie's footsteps.

<strong>2.) God always asks us to stand against evil. </strong>Turn in your own Bibles to Ephesians 6 and read verses 10-20 with your kids. Have them circle each time the word "stand" is used.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your <strong>stand</strong> against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to <strong>stand</strong> your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. <strong>Stand</strong> firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.</p>
</blockquote>
Explain to your children that when we face (or see) evil, the person or group of people involved isn't the source of evil. ("Our struggle is not with flesh and blood.") Therefore, we aren't called to argue, debate, accuse, or label. That's not what the verse instructs.

Instead, we are simply called to "stand." <strong><em>This is a silent but strong action.</em></strong>

We are also called to fearlessly declare the gospel. That is, the name of Jesus and his love for this lost world. (Again note: we are not called to argue, debate, accuse, or label but to speak the name and love of Christ.)

When Natalie posted what she did on Twitter, she was standing but not name calling or debating. The one name she did honor with verbal affirmation was the name of Jesus. Hers was a display of Ephesians 6 at it's best.

<strong>3.) God does not always require us to speak out against evil.</strong> When Jesus was on the earth the Roman culture was corrupt. King Herod was a brutal, baby-killing murder. The Olympics were a hedonistic, pagan religious festival. Many wanted Jesus to speak out against these things.

He didn't.

He just loved.

It is critical that we have a solid Biblical theology about music, sexuality, occult activity and more. In our Bible studies, church meetings and conferences we SHOULD talk about these things. <strong><em>But do we bring the lost closer to Jesus by telling them that they are bad? Usually not. I've never won someone to Christ by convincing them that they are wrong and I am right</em></strong>.

They come to Christ because they feel loved. By Him through me.

Natalie has chosen not to speak out against any specific songs, lyrics, actions or artists. For those who are trying to make this about one single performance or issue, here is what Natalie posted on her Facebook page Monday:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"I've tried to read all of the comments on my previous post but I can't respond to them all. Most of you have always been so supportive and encouraging to me &amp; I'm grateful. It does sadden me when people argue, judge and hurl insults at each other from both sides of the fence. I'm not going to engage in arguments, but just have a few things I'd like to say:<br data-reactid=".f.1:3:1:$comment578144675609524_3493718:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.0:3.0.3.0.$end:0:$1:0" />I NEVER said I left during any particular performance.

I hate no one. And I believe that every person has been created in the image of God. I will never stand on a street corner and wave a sign, I won't use my platform to engage in political arguments that will only divide and not unite. I will continue to pray that my life will be my message. I do have my own personal convictions that I live by, and I will continue to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord.

<p style="text-align: left;">A brilliant, humble, and well-spoken testimony. Full of the courage to stand and the name of Jesus. Void of name-calling and arguing. This is one "celebrity" our daughter's can learn from. So, let's talk about it with them!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your daughter is going to have friends who are lost. They will act in ways they should not, listen to music that is vulgar, and maybe even make sexual choices that are contrary to God's word.</p>
She will not win them to Jesus unless she loves them.

Our inner city outreach is entirely FREE to moms and daughters in NYC. The first 500 mom/daughter(s) will leave with a bag of FREE resources to bring them closer to each other and to Jesus. This includes a Secret Keeper Girl Mother/Daughter 8 Great Dates Book, A Secret Keeper Girl Bible Study, and a 1 Girl Nation CD. At the end of the night, we minister to these moms and daughters in prayer for as long as they need it. (Here's one of my favorite photos from our first inner city outreach in 2011.)

My team has been trying to get me' at line 1 for query UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = 'I was standing in line to check out at my pharmacy the other day when I saw the most frightening sight. A teeny-tiny barely-there skirt clinging to boney hips was all that stood between me and a clear view of the most skeletally thin legs I'd seen on a grown woman in my life: thigh gap! My team has been trying to get me to blog about it, but until I saw it first hand I didn't realize how horrifying it really can be. The young woman in front of me looked a lot like this photo, which I found at the proud blog of an anorexic.  As unattractive as you might find this, all-too-many tween and teen girls find it appealing...sexy even. And they'll do anything to achieve it. And many girls who obsess about thigh gap, end up struggling with eating disorders.

<em>Think your daughter is to bright to fall for that?</em> You might consider that it's often the brightest and most promising young girls that fall for anorexia.

<em>Think your daughter's too young to fall for that?</em> Anorexia often hits girls in their tween years, not their teen years, with some eating disorder clinic patients being as young as five. (Bulimia tends to hit when a girl is older.)

So let's muscle up our minds, moms! And be brave enough to have real conversations about a real problem. Here are five things you need to discuss with your daughter.

<strong>1.) Ask her if she knows about thigh gap and what she thinks about it?</strong> Your daughter's body condition, the existence or lack of a thigh gap, and conversation about it will not be what clues you in to a problem. In general, girls who loathe their bodies don't wake up one day and say, "Hey, mom. I really hate my body. I think I'll starve myself until I achieve thigh gap. Yeah! A little miserable anorexia sounds just great!" You have to ask. I have two especially thin daughters and we have open conversations about their weight and how they feel about themselves. This always begins with me asking about trends and just hearing their heart on the matter. You might also note if there is a sudden interest in diet or exercise, as sometimes that is a sign of the obsession.

<strong>2.) Explain to her that a thigh gap is not about how skinny a person is, but how their bone structure was formed at birth</strong>. Doctors warn that very few women have the true bone structure that leads to thigh gap naturally and healthfully. I found this great illustration on a <a href="http://fitnesstreats.tumblr.com/post/29683222718/hi-im-on-my-way-to-losing-weight-and-one-of-the">women's health and nutrition site</a>. You might share it with your daughter.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3529 aligncenter" alt="tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tumblr_m70an5EOPi1r97gquo1_1280-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>3.) Show her photos of photoshopped thigh gap and explain that it's usually not real.</strong> Then, show her examples of real women in video or photos where you can see how a woman is supposed to look. (No gap!) As much as you'd like to think she never sees these kinds of photos, she probably does. It's better to show them to her and talk about it than to pretend they don't exist.

<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/21lud1e.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3530 aligncenter" alt="21lud1e" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/21lud1e-300x287.jpg" width="300" height="287" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>4.) Explain to her the risk of reducing body fat to the point of actually having "thigh gap."</strong> Risks include harming your body to the point of creating "brain gap." You better believe it. Losing too much weight can impact your brain, heart, lungs. It can also lead to loss of her period if she's already cycling. Nothing good comes of excessive weight loss.

<strong>5.) Above all, pray!</strong> I remember reading in Beth Moore's "Feather's From My Nest" of the account of praying her daughter <a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/inspirationalteaching/moore_magazines.aspx">Melissa's struggle</a> with an eating disorder. Oh, how that mama prayed. And called down the power of heaven to reduce the stronghold in Melissa's mind to rubble. What a glorious day it was when her daughter realized that she was feasting her eyes on images that were unattainable and unholy and asked her mother to come help her take magazine pages off her bedroom wall! Remember, whatever we worship and dwell on will inform what we believe about ourselves.

At the risk of sounding sacreligious and trite (but, oh, I rely on a lotta laughter to get me through the ugliest stuff), I invite you to share with your daughter these "celebs" who really do have real "thigh gap!" Perhaps that will curb her appetite!

Therefore, I'm often fielding questions on related topics including the HPV vaccination, Gardasil, which the Center For Disease Control recommends for girls and boys aged 11 and 12 (though it can be given as early as year nine). I'm not a medical professional, and you should seek the advice of a variety of professionals in the field before you make a decision because you will find their opinions varied. Here are a few facts and some links to those whose opinion I sought before decided that I would wait a little longer to decide if I will administer the vaccine to my girls. For now, I'm choosing not to do so.

<strong>What is HPV?</strong>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus">HPV</a> is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States of America. It is a common denominator in all cases of cervical cancer. There are approximately 30-40 strains of the virus. The human body is capable of clearing the infection. 70% of cases clear within one year. 90% within two. Of the remaining 10%, about half will experience cervical cancer within 10-15 years. PAP tests are used to detect pre-cancerous cells. Cervical cancer is treatable.

<strong>What is Gardasil?</strong>

<a href="http://www.gardasil.com/">Gardasil</a> is a vaccine that protects users from four of the many strains of HPV. These strains are responsible for about 70-75% of cervical cancer (depending on which source you cite). Seventy percent sounds like a big number so it's important to look at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cervical.htm">risk</a> of cervical cancer more closely. About 8 in 100,000 women experience cervical cancer each year. There are 1.9-3.7 deaths per year per 100,000 women as a result. One death is too many and every effort should be made to prevent these deaths, but questions need to be asked in terms of the efficacy of Gardasil and the risk to each vaccinated user before a final decision should be made for each individual.

<strong>What are the risks of Gardisil?</strong>

The C<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm?s_cid=mm6229a4_w">enter for Disease Control</a> and the World Health Organization stands by its opinion that the drug is safe for use. Their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm?s_cid=mm6229a4_w">reports</a> state that between June 2006 and March 2013,  21,194 recievers of the vaccination reported adverse reactions. Most of these were considered "non-serious." Proponents of the vaccination state the the only weak link in the plan to eliminate cervical cancer is that <a href="http://acsh.org/2013/07/hpv-vaccines-effective-but-vaccination-rates-still-low/">"doctors are failing to encourage their patients to recieve the vaccination."</a> The question must be asked: why?

Many credible American <a href="http://pop.org/content/merck-researcher-admits-gardasil-guards-against-almost-nothing-985">groups</a> have made public statements that the drug is dangerous. Reports of adverse reactions range from dizziness and headaches to seizures. The country of <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041099_Gardasil_side_effect_Japan_infertility.html">Japan</a> has withdrawn its support of the drug. While it will not pull the vaccination, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare no longer recommends the drug and those who receive it must be made well aware of the high risk of adverse reactions. In Japan, there are 1,968 cases that the ministry labels adverse and many are labeled as "severe" including "long term pain and numbness and infertility and paralysis." In August 2013, the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041512_Gardasil_ovary_destruction_HPV_vaccine.html">Australian</a> equivalent of the FDA concluded that the maker of Gardasil did not adequately test the impact of the drug on the reproductive system of women. A report in the <a href="http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2012/bcr-2012-006879.abstract">British Medical Journal</a> reported pre-mature ovarian failure in a sixteen-year-old as a result of the vaccination.

<strong>What Should I Do?</strong>
You should talk to your daughter early and thoroughly about the risk of sex outside of marriage. And before she is sexually active, she needs to consider with you whether or not her behavior puts herself and others at risk of sexually transmitted disease. This decision is not an easy one.

While our mission is the same: to bring the hearts of moms and daughters closer to each other and to Jesus, our content in the Crazy Hair Tour is all-new. I'm happy to share a few critical differences with you, but first let me assure you that our mission is being accomplished. One mom wrote in this week to tell us how much she loved the new event and wrote this: "I asked my daughter her favorite thing about the show. Her response: “I don’t know, it was all fun. I guess that I feel closer to you now. I don’t know why, I just do.” My heart is beating right out of my chest with joy! Here are some other cool things you need to know about the new event:

<strong>1.) <a href="http://www.1girlnation.com/">1 Girl Nation</a> is currently touring with us.</strong> This new group of five twenty-somethings who love Jesus "like crazy" (and have a song to prove it) are fantastic role models with some serious pipes. Disillusioned with Miley? Throw her music out. You won't need it after your daughter meets Kayli, Lauryn Taylor, Lindsey, Kelsey, and Carmen. <strong><em>We have integrated them right into the event, but you'll want to come half an hour early to hear their pre-show concert.</em></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1GN.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3395" alt="1GN" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1GN-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2.) The new theme encourages girls to denounce being normal (read: boy-crazy, obsessed with beauty, mean girls, etc) and embrace the idea of being totally God-crazy.</strong> My heart has been so burdened with the growing pressure for our little girls to grow up too fast and to follow the empty-headed crowd. If they do, the role models they feast upon with be Miley Cyrus and the behavior will have them looking like they are seventeen when they are seven. Someone had to sound an alarm, inviting them to stick out for Jesus. As I prayed, I remembered a verse that my dear friend and board member Laurel Mench handed me once. I have treasured it in my Bible since she gave it to me. II Corinthians 5:13-21 reads "If I acted crazy, I did it for God...Christ's love has moved me to such extremes. his love has the first and last word in everything we do." It became an anthem for our team as we developed the script for the Crazy Hair Tour. The teaching surrounding this verse is meaty. And your daughters will memorize it by the end of the night. That was very important to us as we prayed. We hope they go on to internalize this truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BibleMemory.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3397 aligncenter" alt="BibleMemory" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BibleMemory-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3.) All-new stories and lessons featuring a fan favorite from the start: <em>The Chicken Who Wanted To Be A Peacock.</em></strong> Even this story, based on a true story about Napoleon the Peacock who lives on my farm, calls girls out to be crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peacock.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3398 aligncenter" alt="Peacock" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peacock-300x156.jpg" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5.) The It's Sew Crazy Fashion Show is new and different.</strong> Get your needle and thread out and get ready for the It's SEW Crazy Fashion Show. Each outfit was modified using a simple mother/daughter sewing project. We will be posting those crafts here in September and October so you have a fun project to complete when you get home. (If ya want!) The outfit below was created using iron on decals. (Can you say "simple?") And that's my precious niece Rebecca in the photo!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3401 aligncenter" alt="543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/543411_10151628624772476_2103215340_n-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4.) And, of course, there's lots of crazy hair!</strong> A favorite part of the Pajama Party Tour was wearing fuzzy slippers and pjs. Leave them at home or you'll look...well, crazy. (So it could work, after all.) But you can certainly wear your crazy hair and many moms are saying this is the best part of the night. "My daughter and I had so much fun going to the store to pick up crazy things for our hair and spent a whole hour in the bathroom laughing before we left for the event. Thank you for that time," wrote one mom!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3399 aligncenter" alt="1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1098177_10151633294462476_1579082222_n-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, whad'ya say? Get crazy with us and help us build an army of girls who are so God-crazy, that the boy crazy train drives right on past! Here's our upcoming <a href="http://purefreedom.org/tour/">tour schedule</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. I don't appear at the Secret Keeper Girl live events. I am still trying to raise my own precious girls. Though they are young adults, I can't be on the road as much as would be demanded. I sure hope I get to meet you someday as I do make frequent speaking engagements. You'll absolutely love my team.</p>' WHERE meta_id = 23557 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php'), do_action('tools_page_velvet-blues-update-urls'), WP_Hook->do_action, WP_Hook->apply_filters, VelvetBluesUU_management_page, VB_update_urls

Forty percent of girls starting their periods have never heard about it from their own parents. Can you imagine how frightening it could be to wake up with bloodstained sheets or be horrified in the school bathroom and not have a clue what it means?

Let's make sure you punctuate your daughter's period with lots of enthusiasm and excitement rather than silence! Here is how you can talk to her in the right time and with the right attitude:

<strong>Prepare for the Conversation Years in Advance</strong>

Yes, begin teaching Sex Ed 101. I started these lessons with Rob and Lexi when they were in pre-school by talking to them about flowers. "You see," I would tell them as we looked into a lily, "even flowers have a daddy part (the pistil) and a mommy part (the stamen)." God created everything to make life. Even flowers! Get started as soon as you can with these simple life lessons and they will come much more naturally. Your willingness to talk openly about such topic ensures that your children will be able to come to YOU for answers.

<strong>Watch for the First Sign of Puberty</strong>

Your daughter's first period is the onset of puberty! There is something that happens one or two years before that. It's the sign to look for. Do you know what that is? Hint: She's got two and so do you! There ya go - you've got it! Breast buds.

&nbsp;

Your daughter's first period is <em>not</em> the onset of puberty! There is something that happens one or two years before that. It's the sign to look for. Do you know what that is? Hint: She's got two and so do you! There ya go - you've got it! Breast buds.<a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stages-puberty-female.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-6799"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6799 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stages-puberty-female-300x159.jpg" alt="stages puberty female" width="300" height="159" /></a>Medical journals say that the average girl experiences the first sign of breast buds at 10.7 years, give or take a little. Every girl develops at her own pace, so be prepared for anything. About 15% of girls experience both breast buds and pubic hair before eight years old, which means they are probably set to menstruate between their ninth and tenth birthday. Even if you are surprised at how soon it happens, <em>she </em>shouldn't be!

<strong>Tell Her About Her Period Between Her Eighth and Tenth Birthdays</strong>

The average age at which a girl has her first period is 12.7 years. This age can deviate by as much as a year and a half. So be prepared to talk to her no later than age nine. Here are two things you can do to make it easy to talk to her about.... "happy week"!

1. Tell her by using pictures of life.

Many moms talk about the basic function of periods, but fail to talk about <em>why</em> we have them. Having a period is God's great sign that he's preparing your daughter to be a mom one day! Here is where you have the wonderful opportunity to use your daughter's entrance into womanhood as a value-formation tool on the wonder of being a mom. <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-in-utero-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-6802"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6802 aligncenter" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-in-utero-2-300x225.jpg" alt="baby-in-utero-2" width="300" height="225" /></a>This transition is so critical for our daughters in this day and age. The feminine quality of motherhood has been under attack, and our daughters are losing. In a 2007 survey over over 1200 Christian teens, the vast majority of them did not want to be mothers and felt motherhood should be a goal secondary to the dreams they had for a career. How sad!

Start with the pictures and then accompany them with any of your specific thoughts about carrying your daughter in your womb, if you had that honor. Read Psalm 139 with your daughter during this time of conversation. This chapter gives you the wonderful opportunity to begin a dialogue to form your daughter's values about <em>true beauty</em> and the value of <em>motherhood</em>.

2. Give her a gift basket with all the necessary supplies. <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/periodpackswtamponsandchoc.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2147 alignright" src="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/periodpackswtamponsandchoc-233x300.jpg" alt="periodpackswtamponsandchoc" width="233" height="300" /></a>

Purchase or put together a <a href="http://www.periodpacks.com/gifts/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=1">cute basket</a> and stuff it full of girl things such as: a new bra, mini-pads, regular pads, teen-formula pain pills, body spray,  books, chocolate, Thermacare menstrual heat wraps, and a letter welcoming her to womanhood.  Also consider including a small zippered canvas or fabric bag that's filled with the basics so she can discreetly take it to school. She might think you are "making a big deal about it," but I guarantee you, she would much rather you celebrate with her and give gifts than her be alone in the bathroom stall at school!

Along with the basket should come a mini-lesson on how to use it all. And, if anyone should happen to twirl a tampon or stick a pad to their forehead, just take a deep breath and laugh!

What do you do, though, when she does start needing one? Let's be realistic. A nine-year-old doesn't need padding. But it can be tricky to find something appropriate for the little girl that you want her to stay, and you busy moms don’t have the time to drag her into every store at the mall.

Summer is quickly approaching and that means the dreaded swimsuit shopping adventure. Let’s just face it. Swimsuits are not modest, period. Nothing about them is. But if you’re going to the beeaaaach (sung to the tune of “rolling in the deep”) this summer, keep these Secret Keeper Girl tips in mind.
<ul>
	<li>Swimwear is for SWIMMING. Swimsuits are fine for jumping in the ocean or pool, but a Secret Keeper Girl covers up when she gets out. “Laying out” may be okay with girlfriends, but not when there are guys around. Whether it’s a pair of board shorts and T-shirt or a fun frilly cover-up, your girls have lots of adorable options!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Focus on what they CAN purchase. Do a bit of online perusing and show your girls some suits you think are modest. We’re partial to tankinis, especially ones with shorts (they’re usually less form-fitting than a one-piece; we’ve had success at places like Kohl’s and some sporting goods stores since athletic suits tends to cover more territory). Set the standard by showing them that modest swimwear can be cute. When you are teaching your girls about modesty, it’s crucial to show them what you can say “yes” to, or all they hear is “no” and that can crush their spirits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Discuss your expectations BEFORE you hit the mall. What mom says goes. As a general rule, we see NO reason for sheer fabric, bikinis, plunging necklines, or high-cut hips. (Of course, sharing an embarrassing moment to prove your point always adds some credibility!</li>
</ul>
And of course, don’t forget to finish off the trip by picking up some super-cool nail polish and stopping in for some refreshing summer smoothies.

For more modesty boosting ideas as we head into the warmer months, <a href="https://truegirl.dannahgresh.com/_blog/tour/">come to the Secret Keeper Girl Crazy Hair Show</a> where we discuss our Truth or Bare Fashion Tests during our LIVE fashion show! You seriously won't want to miss!

This one is so simple, that it's a great recipe to teach your daughter measuring and mixing. It makes for some really fun mother/daughter kitchen time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Lemon Moon Cookies</strong>

1 box lemon cake mix

2 cups Cool Whip topping

1 egg, beaten

2 T. lemon juice

Mix all of the above ingredients together. The mixture will be like a sticky pizza dough though not stretchy. Take a teaspoon full of batter and drop it into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Then, put the sugar dipped drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cook at 350 for 11 minutes. Let cool before letting them melt in your mouth!

It can print as a one-sided piece. Or you can opt to download a backside and then the piece can be folded to 8.5' x 5.5' and tabbed for direct mailing.

They are presented two per 8.5x11 sheet and can be laser printed. You may use our full color or black and white option. If you print in black and white we recommend hot pink paper! Our designers and printers have stated that this quality should work whether you print on a laser printer or whether you take it to a commercial printer. Enjoy the ease!
